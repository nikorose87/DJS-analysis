    "Most of the researchers, who attempt to design the proper ankle-foot prosthesis, must study the biomechanics of the ankle joint in order to obtain the dynamic conditions of that part of the body, synthesizing this mechanical behavior in the angle-moment chart or also known as quasi-stiffness slope.  In addition, with the aim of mimicking the Dynamic Joint Stiffness (DJS) to be generated, most of the studies that relate the ankle quasi-stiffness tried to linearized each subphase of the human gait in consideration of getting the constant elastic coefficient of the material and/or mechanism that will return the energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the DJS of the ankle will depend on the speed, weight, and height of the subject. However, abnormalities in gait affect the regular behavior of the DJS. With the rise of the study of this field, various investigations were done at particular circumstances and the need of establishing patterns according to specific parameters in gait have arrived.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we did a systematic search in the literature, research center websites and clinical databases. After founding the possible and reliable data to be analyzed, we selected some candidates (papers or databases) with the purpose of figuring out concordances in the results of each one ---in the case of having same inputs--- or to establishing differences according to the biomechanical parameters determined on each case of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second of all, pure data of the selected candidates were extracted and filtered so that insights about the dynamic behavior of the ankle could describe unseen aspects of different types of gait.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the above, we tried to identify better linear approximations at different instances of the ankle DJS and compared with non-linear approximations of the quasi-stiffness in terms of statistics. Moreover, with those similarities, we figure out the relationship between the ankle-moment and ankle-angle around all the loop, e.g. establishing gait sub-phases, work involved on the DJS, differences in gait parameters as gait speed, gender, age, different intentions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this work attempts to serve as a meta-analysis of different literature data in order to describe the DJS at different conditions or gait intentions, this information could help to prosthesis designers so that tuning their active devices on each intention or type of gait."

    "METHODS: We performed an electronic search via the PubMed, EMBASE and ISI Web of Knowledge databases from 1979 to May 2009. Two independent reviewers assessed the title and abstract of each identified study. The quality assessment of the full text was undertaken using a 13-item checklist divided into three levels: A, B, and C.\n",
    "RESULTS: The literature search identified 584 abstracts to be considered. After applying the inclusion criteria, we reviewed the full text of a total of 89 articles. The mean article quality was 8±2. No A-level article was found; the primary reason was a negative score in blinded outcome assessment. Sixty-six articles (74{\\%}) corresponded to a B-level, and two articles (2{\\%}) corresponded to a C-level. Twenty-one articles (24{\\%}) did not acquire enough points to be assigned to any level. In this study, we present and discuss the most commonly used and most relevant 32 parameters. Many of the parameters found were not reported in enough studies or in enough detail to allow a useful evaluation.\n",

Different methods and strategies have been introduced to create such smooth trajectories. This paper studies the creation of human-like movements in haptic interfaces, based on the study of human arm motion. These motions are intended to retrain the upper limb movements of patients that lose manipulation functions following stroke. We present a model that uses higher degree polynomials to define a trajectory and control the robot arm to achieve minimum jerk movements. It also studies different methods that can be driven from polynomials to create more realistic human-like movements for therapeutic purposes.},\n",

Yet, the literature evidences suggest that some pathologies (especially at onset or subclinical level) may not primarily affect plain gait, but more demanding locomotor tasks. In the present study we therefore propose a multiple-task gait analysis protocol including: self-selected, increased and decreased speed gait; walking on toes; walking on heels; step ascending and step descending, and apply it to 40 healthy subjects (20 aged 6-17, 20 aged 22-72) thus building extensive reference data set. Published studies already report normative data for some of these tasks, but inhomogeneously (due to different collecting methods and biomechanical models, population characteristics, nature of data). We verify a good correlation between our results and those presented by Schwartz et al. (2008) [12] in their study providing extensive data on the effect of walking speed on the gait of healthy children. In discussing the results, the rationale and effectiveness of each task is confirmed, and we supply an electronic addendum with comprehensive kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic normative data for the considered population, along with a set of reference parameters and related statistical analysis, as a premise for further applications on pathological subjects.},\n",

We know little about how they interact when faced with real-world physical demands (e.g. carrying loads). Here, we investigated how each system (i.e. amputee and powered prosthesis) responds to changes in the prosthesis mechanics and gravitational load. Five transfemoral amputees walked with and without load (i.e. weighted backpack) and a powered knee prosthesis with two pre-programmed controller settings (i.e. for load and no load). We recorded subjects' kinematics, kinetics, and perceived exertion. Compared to the no load setting, the load setting reduced subjects' perceived exertion and intact-limb stance time when they carried load. When subjects did not carry load, their perceived exertion and gait performance did not significantly change with controller settings. Our results suggest transfemoral amputees could benefit from load-adaptive powered knee controllers, and controller adjustments affect amputees more when they walk with (versus without) load. Further understanding of the interaction between powered prostheses, amputee users, and various environments may allow researchers to expand the utility of prostheses beyond simple environments (e.g. firm level ground without load) that represent only a subset of real-world environments.},\n",

This work is motivated by the needs of persons with disabilities and by a desire to expand basic understanding of human walking. We address human gait from the perspective of dynamic walking, a theoretical approach to legged locomotion which emphasizes the use of simple dynamical models and focuses on behavior over the course of many steps rather than within a single step. We build on results from prior dynamic walking research and develop new areas of exploration, with energetics and stability providing context. We focus on three areas: improvement of prosthetic foot design, the function of arm swinging, and evaluation of balance among the elderly. These issues are addressed by use of dynamic walking models and controlled human subject experiments. We propose a Controlled Energy Storage and Return (CESR) foot prosthesis to increase push-off work and reduce energy expenditure in amputees, and tested a prototype experimentally. To better understand the role of arms swinging in gait, we developed a simple dynamic walking model with free-swinging arms and performed human subject experiments in which subjects swung their arms in various ways. Finally, we studied the effects of aging on balance during walking using a computational model and a human subject experiment in which younger and older adults walked overground for hundreds of consecutive steps. These models and experiments each expand our understanding of the fundamentals of gait and indicate pathways toward assisting individuals with disabilities. Taken as a whole, this work emphasizes the utility of the dynamic walking approach.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Humans normally dissipate significant energy during walking, largely at the transitions between steps. The ankle then acts to restore energy during push-off, which may be the reason that ankle impairment nearly always leads to poorer walking economy. The replacement of lost energy is necessary for steady gait, in which mechanical energy is constant on average, external dissipation is negligible, and no net work is performed over a stride. However, dissipation and replacement by muscles might not be necessary if energy were instead captured and reused by an assistive device. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a microprocessor-controlled artificial foot that captures some of the energy that is normally dissipated by the leg and \"recycles\" it as positive ankle work. In tests on subjects walking with an artificially-impaired ankle, a conventional prosthesis reduced ankle push-off work and increased net metabolic energy expenditure by 23{\\%} compared to normal walking. Energy recycling restored ankle push-off to normal and reduced the net metabolic energy penalty to 14{\\%}. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that reduced ankle push-off contributes to the increased metabolic energy expenditure accompanying ankle impairments, and demonstrate that energy recycling can be used to reduce such cost.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Aim of this study was to provide a non-invasive assessment of the dynamic properties of the ankle joint during human locomotion, with specific focus on the effects of gender and age. Accordingly, flexion-extension angles and moments, obtained through gait analysis, were used to generate moment-angle loops at the ankle joint in 120 healthy subjects walking at a same normalized speed. Four reproducible types of loops were identified: Typical Loops, Narrow, Large and Yielding loops. No significant changes in the slopes of the main loop phases were observed as a function of gender and age, with the exception of a relative increase in the slope of the descending phase in elderly males compared to adult females. As for the ergometric parameters, the peak ankle moment, work produced and net work along the cycle were slightly, but significantly affected, with progressively decrease in the following order: Adult Males, Adult Females, Elderly Males and Elderly Females. The evidence that only few of the quantitative aspects of moment-angle loops were affected suggests that the control strategy which regulates the biomechanical properties of the ankle joint during walking is rather robust and qualitatively consistent across genders and age.},\n",

Simulations can also be used to identify the sources of pathological movement and establish a scientific basis for treatment planning. We have developed a freely available, open-source software system (OpenSim) that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal structures and create dynamic simulations of a wide variety of movements. We are using this system to simulate the dynamics of individuals with pathological gait and to explore the biomechanical effects of treatments. OpenSim provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through a multi-institutional collaboration. Developing software that enables a concerted effort from many investigators poses technical and sociological challenges. Meeting those challenges will accelerate the discovery of principles that govern movement control and improve treatments for individuals with movement pathologies.},\n",

The foot is highly specialised thus these changes in structure/position could influence functionality. This review aims to investigate the effect of footwear on gait, specifically focussing on studies that have assessed kinematics, kinetics and muscle activity between walking barefoot and in common footwear. In line with PRISMA and published guidelines, a literature search was completed across six databases comprising Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, AMED, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Fifteen of 466 articles met the predetermined inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All articles were assessed for methodological quality using a modified assessment tool based on the STROBE statement for reporting observational studies and the CASP appraisal tool. Walking barefoot enables increased forefoot spreading under load and habitual barefoot walkers have anatomically wider feet. Spatial-temporal differences including, reduced step/stride length and increased cadence, are observed when barefoot. Flatter foot placement, increased knee flexion and a reduced peak vertical ground reaction force at initial contact are also reported. Habitual barefoot walkers exhibit lower peak plantar pressures and pressure impulses, whereas peak plantar pressures are increased in the habitually shod wearer walking barefoot. Footwear particularly affects the kinematics and kinetics of gait acutely and chronically. Little research has been completed in older age populations (50+ years) and thus further research is required to better understand the effect of footwear on walking across the lifespan.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Introduction: Amobile arm support (MAS) such as the passive systems JAECO WREX [1] or the ARMON device [2] can help persons with neuromuscular weakness to perform activities of daily living (ADL) autonomously. The presented work is part of the EU project MUNDUS (MUltimodal Neuroprosthesis for Daily Upper limb Support) and focuses on the design of a MAS that provides weight support for the patients arm and the possibility to block the essential degrees of freedom at defined positions. In clinical application this exoskeleton will be combined with Neuro Muscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to support patients with degenerative neuronal diseases or high level Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI). Patients/materials and methods: With a 3D-infrared-motioncature-system we determined the necessary range of motions (ROM) to perform ADL e.g. eating, or combing the hair. The weight supporting spring was calculated with Matlab taking several mechanical solutions into account. Focusing on simplicity and modularity the presented concept was designed in Catia V5 R19. Results: The preliminary investigation resulted in a design with two degrees of freedom (DoF) at the shoulder, one at the elbow joint and one for pro- and supination. Fig. 1 shows the digital mockup of the MAS mounted on a wheelchair. Due to the lightweight construction (3.4 kg) the MAS can also be worn with a body harness. Depending on the degree of motor deficiency and the effected muscle groups motors are foreseen to actuate the required DoF in addition to NMES. The weight compensating spring is integrated in the z-tube. Its pre-stressing can either be adjusted manually or by an electric motor. The compensation force of the spring is transmitted via a rope to the x-lever, on which the upper arm shell is mounted on a linear guide. The braking unit for the shoulder flexion and extension is realized as a strap brake mechanism. The bearings of the mechanical elbow joint are integrated into the electromagnetic brake. A pro- and supination module, which can be attached to the forearm rod, is also prepared to carry a hand module that can activate the fingers. Discussion and conclusion: The design concept offers a lightweight MAS with four lockable DoF. The modular concept is easy to adjust to different anthropological sizes and is both-sided. A prototype is being built to evaluate its functionality in a following study with patients at the rehabilitation centre.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {The non-disabled human ankle joint was examined during walking in an attempt to determine overall system characteristics for use in the design of ankle prostheses. The hypothesis of the study was that the quasi-stiffness of the ankle changes when walking at different walking speeds. The hypothesis was examined using sagittal plane ankle moment versus ankle angle curves from 24 able-bodied subjects walking over a range of speeds. The slopes of the moment versus ankle angle curves (quasi-stiffness) during loading appeared to change as speed was increased and the relationship between the moment and angle during loading became increasingly non-linear. The loading and unloading portions of the moment versus angle curves showed clockwise loops (hysteresis) at self-selected slow speeds that reduced essentially to zero as the speed increased to self-selected normal speeds. Above self-selected normal speeds, the loops started to traverse a counter-clockwise path that increased in area as the speed was increased. These characteristics imply that the human ankle joint could be effectively replaced with a rotational spring and damper for slow to normal walking speeds. However, to mimic the characteristics of the human ankle during walking at fast speeds, an augmented system would be necessary. This notion is supported by the sign of the ankle power at the time of opposite heel contact, which was negative for slow speeds, was near zero at normal speeds, and was positive for fast walking speeds. {\\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Ankle joint stiffness is a potential underlying mechanism for the greater rate of injury within these two functionally different groups. An alternative candidate mechanism of injury in HA and LA athletes pertains to the efficacy of the foot as a rigid lever during propulsion. The purpose of this study was to quantify the differences in ankle dynamic joint stiffness, and ankle braking work and ankle propulsive work during stance phase of running. Methods: Ten HA and ten LA athletes performed five barefoot running trials while ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics were recorded. Ankle dynamic joint stiffness was calculated as the slope of the ankle joint moment-ankle joint angle plot during load attenuation. Ankle braking and propulsive work values were calculated for the stance phase. Results: HA athletes had significantly greater ankle dynamic joint stiffness and significantly smaller ankle net and propulsive work than LA athletes. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that HA and LA athletes exhibit unique biomechanical patterns during running. These patterns may be related to lower extremity injury. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {The ankle contributes the majority of mechanical power during walking and is a frequently studied joint in biomechanics. Specifically, researchers have extensively investigated the torque-angle relationship for the ankle during dynamic tasks, such as walking and running. The slope of this relationship has been termed the \"quasi-stiffness.\" However, over time, researchers have begun to interchange the concepts of quasi-stiffness and stiffness. This is an especially important distinction as researchers currently begin to investigate the appropriate control systems for recently developed powered prosthetic legs. The quasi-stiffness and stiffness are distinct concepts in the context of powered joints, and are equivalent in the context of passive joints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the difference between the stiffness and quasi-stiffness using a simple impedance-controlled inverted pendulum model and a more sophisticated biped walking model, each with the ability to modify the trajectory of an impedance controller's equilibrium angle position. In both cases, stiffness values are specified by the controller and the quasi-stiffness are shown during a single step. Both models have widely varying quasi-stiffness but each have a single stiffness value. Therefore, from this simple modeling approach, the differences and similarities between these two concepts are elucidated.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Human joint impedance is the dynamic relationship between the differential change in the position of a perturbed joint and the corresponding response torque; it is a fundamental property that governs how humans interact with their environments. It is critical to characterize ankle impedance during the stance phase of walking to elucidate how ankle impedance is regulated during locomotion, as well as provide the foundation for future development of natural, biomimetic powered prostheses and their control systems. In this study, ankle impedance was estimated using a model consisting of stiffness, damping and inertia. Ankle torque was well described by the model, accounting for 98 ±1.2{\\%} of the variance. When averaged across subjects, the stiffness component of impedance was found to increase linearly from 1.5 to 6.5 Nm/rad/kg between 20{\\%} and 70{\\%} of stance phase. The damping component was found to be statistically greater than zero only for the estimate at 70{\\%} of stance phase, with a value of 0.03 Nms/rad/kg. The slope of the ankle's torque-angle curve-known as the quasi-stiffness-was not statistically different from the ankle stiffness values, and showed remarkable similarity. Finally, using the estimated impedance, the specifications for a biomimetic powered ankle prosthesis were introduced that would accurately emulate human ankle impedance during locomotion.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Background: Ankle characteristics vary in terms of gait phase and speed change. This study aimed to quantify the components of ankle characteristics, including quasi-stiffness and work in different gait phases and at various speeds. Methods: The kinetic and kinematic data of 20 healthy participants were collected during normal gait at four speeds. Stance moment-angle curves were divided into three sub-phases including controlled plantarflexion, controlled dorsiflexion and powered plantarflexion. The slope of the moment-angle curves was quantified as quasi-stiffness. The area under the curves was defined as work. Results: The lowest quasi-stiffness was observed in the controlled plantarflexion. The fitted line to moment-angle curves showed R 2 {\\textgreater} 0.8 at controlled dorsiflexion and powered plantarflexion. Quasi-stiffness was significantly different at different speeds (P = 0.00). In the controlled dorsiflexion, the ankle absorbed energy; by comparison, energy was generated in the powered plantarflexion. A negative work value was recorded at slower speeds and a positive value was observed at faster speeds. Ankle peak powers were increased with walking speed (P = 0.00). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the quasi-stiffness and work of the ankle joint can be regulated at different phases and speeds. These findings may be clinically applicable in the design and development of ankle prosthetic devices that can naturally replicate human walking at various gait speeds.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND Dynamic stiffness can be used for studying foot pathologic abnormalities and for developing prostheses and orthoses. Although previous works have studied the role of ankle joint stiffness during gait, other foot joints have not yet been analyzed. We sought to characterize the dynamic stiffness of the ankle, midtarsal, and metatarsophalangeal joints during normal walking. METHODS Kinematics and contact data from four healthy individuals during walking were registered with a three-dimensional motion analysis system and a pressure platform. Stance phases with flexion moment-angle linear relationships were identified, and dynamic stiffnesses were calculated from the slope of their linear regressions. Intraparticipant repeatability was analyzed using analyses of variance, and interparticipant variability was checked through the SD of averaged participant stiffnesses. RESULTS Flexion moment-angle linear relationships were identified (R(2) {\\textgreater} 0.98) during the early and late midstance phases and the propulsion phase at the ankle (2.76, 5.23, and 3.42 N{\\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad, respectively) and midtarsal (15.88, 3.90, and 4.64 N{\\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad, respectively) joints. At the metatarsophalangeal joint, a linear relationship (R(2) {\\textgreater} 0.96) occurred only during the propulsion phase (0.11 N{\\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad). High dynamic stiffness variability was observed during the late and early midstance phases at the ankle and midtarsal joints, respectively. CONCLUSIONS These results may serve as a basis for future studies aimed at investigating the role of dynamic stiffness identified herein in different foot disorders. The importance of properly controlling the samples in such studies is highlighted. Study of the dynamic stiffnesses identified might be used in the design of prostheses, orthoses, and other assistive devices.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Characterizing the quasi-stiffness and work of lower extremity joints is critical for evaluating human locomotion and designing assistive devices such as prostheses and orthoses intended to emulate the biological behavior of human legs. This work aims to establish statistical models that allow us to predict the ankle quasi-stiffness and net mechanical work for adults walking on level ground. During the stance phase of walking, the ankle joint propels the body through three distinctive phases of nearly constant stiffness known as the quasi-stiffness of each phase. Using a generic equation for the ankle moment obtained through an inverse dynamics analysis, we identify key independent parameters needed to predict ankle quasi-stiffness and propulsive work and also the functional form of each correlation. These parameters include gait speed, ankle excursion, and subject height and weight. Based on the identified form of the correlation and key variables, we applied linear regression on experimental walking data for 216 gait trials across 26 subjects (speeds from 0.75-2.63 m/s) to obtain statistical models of varying complexity. The most general forms of the statistical models include all the key parameters and have an R(2) of 75{\\%} to 81{\\%} in the prediction of the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and propulsive work. The most specific models include only subject height and weight and could predict the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and work for optimal walking speed with average error of 13{\\%} to 30{\\%}. We discuss how these models provide a useful framework and foundation for designing subject- and gait-specific prosthetic and exoskeletal devices designed to emulate biological ankle function during level ground walking.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Unilateral lower limb prosthesis users display temporal, kinematic, and kinetic asymmetries between limbs while ascending and descending stairs. These asymmetries are due, in part, to the inability of current prosthetic devices to effectively mimic normal ankle function. The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive set of biomechanical data for able-bodied and unilateral transtibial amputee (TTA) ankle-foot systems for level-ground (LG), stair ascent (SA), and stair descent (SD), and to characterize deviations from normal performance associated with prosthesis use. Ankle joint kinematics, kinetics, torque-angle curves, and effective shapes were calculated for twelve able-bodied individuals and twelve individuals with TTA. The data from this study demonstrated the prosthetic limb can more effectively mimic the range of motion and power output of a normal ankle-foot during LG compared to SA and SD. There were larger differences between the prosthetic and able-bodied limbs during SA and SD, most evident in the torque-angle curves and effective shapes. These data can be used by persons designing ankle-foot prostheses and provide comparative data for assessment of future ankle-foot prosthesis designs.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Over the last half-century, the field of prosthetic engineering has continuously evolved with much attention being dedicated to restoring the mechanical energy properties of ankle joint musculatures during gait. However, the contributions of 'distal foot structures' (e.g., foot muscles, plantar soft tissue) have been overlooked. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the total mechanical energy profiles (e.g., power, work, and work-ratio) of the natural ankle-foot system (NAFS) by combining the contributions of the ankle joint and all distal foot structures during stance in level-ground steady state walking across various speeds (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 statures/s). The results from eleven healthy subjects walking barefoot indicated ankle joint and distal foot structures generally performed opposing roles: the ankle joint performed net positive work that systematically increased its energy generation with faster walking speeds, while the distal foot performed net negative work that systematically increased its energy absorption with faster walking speeds. Accounting for these simultaneous effects, the combined ankle-foot system exhibited increased work-ratios with faster walking. Most notably, the work-ratio was not significantly greater than 1.0 during the normal walking speed of 0.8 statures/s. Therefore, a prosthetic design that strategically exploits passive-dynamic properties (e.g., elastic energy storage and return) has the potential to replicate the mechanical energy profiles of the NAFS during level-ground steady-state walking.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Tools have been used for millions of years to augment the capabilities of the human body, allowing us to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Powered exoskeletons and other assistive devices are sophisticated modern tools that have restored bipedal locomotion in individuals with paraplegia and have endowed unimpaired individuals with superhuman strength. Despite these successes, designing assistive devices that reduce energy consumption during running remains a substantial challenge, in part because these devices disrupt the dynamics of a complex, finely tuned biological system. Furthermore, designers have hitherto relied primarily on experiments, which cannot report muscle-level energy consumption and are fraught with practical challenges. In this study, we use OpenSim to generate muscle-driven simulations of 10 human subjects running at 2 and 5 m/s. We then add ideal, massless assistive devices to our simulations and examine the predicted changes in muscle recruitment patterns and metabolic power consumption. Our simulations suggest that an assistive device should not necessarily apply the net joint moment generated by muscles during unassisted running, and an assistive device can reduce the activity of muscles that do not cross the assisted joint. Our results corroborate and suggest biomechanical explanations for similar effects observed by experimentalists, and can be used to form hypotheses for future experimental studies. The models, simulations, and software used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and can provide insight into assistive device design that complements experimental approaches.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Moment-angle relationship (dynamic joint stiffness) - the relationship between changes in joint moment and changes in joint angle - is useful for demonstrating interaction of kinematics and kinetics during gait. However, the individual contributors of dynamic joint stiffness are not well studied and understood, which has thus far limited its clinical application. In this study, ankle dynamic joint stiffness was analyzed and decomposed into three components in thirty able-bodied children during the stance phase of the gait. To verify the accuracy of the decomposition, the sum of decomposed components was compared to stiffness computed from experimental data, and good to very good agreement was found. Component 1, the term associated with changes in ground reaction force moment, was the dominant contribution to ankle dynamic joint stiffness. Retrospective data from eight children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and idiopathic toe-walking was examined to explore the potential utility of analytical decomposition in pathological gait. Compared to controls, component 1 was the source of highest deviation in both pathological groups. Specifically, ankle dynamic joint stiffness differences can be further identified via two sub-components of component 1 which are based on magnitudes and rates of change of the ground reaction force and of its moment arm, and differences between the two patient groups and controls were most evident and interpretable here. Findings of the current study indicate that analytical decomposition can help identify the individual contributors to joint stiffness and clarify the sources of differences in patient groups. {\\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

    "  Abstract                 = {Gait analysis is the systematic study of human walking, using the eye and brain of experienced observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body movements, body mechanics and the activity of the muscles. In individuals with conditions affecting their ability to walk, gait analysis may be used to make detailed diagnoses and to plan optimal treatment. Over the past few years, gait analysis has ‘come of age' and in a number of centers it is now used routinely to provide the best possible care for certain groups of patients, most notably those with cerebral palsy. Since the benefits of this approach have been well established, it is to be hoped that its usage will continue to spread, so that many more will benefit from the better treatment decisions which can be made when gait analysis is used. I am happy to believe that the first three editions of this book have contributed to this process, by providing a text which does not require a high level of academic learning to be understood. I have heard from people all over the world that they have found the book useful and this I find very gratifying. The next stage in the evolution of gait analysis will hopefully involve improvements in the ease and speed with which gait data can be collected and interpreted, and decreases in the cost of the equipment and the skill level needed to use it. Significant strides have been made in all these aspects since the third edition of the book was published},\n",

Problems arise when calculating the muscle-tendon work from increases in mechanical energy, largely in correctly attributing these increases either to energy transfer or to muscle-tendon work. In this study, the kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the centre of mass of the whole human body was measured (using a force platform) simultaneously with calculation of the kinetic and potential energy of the body segments due to their movements relative to the body centre of mass (using cinematography) at different speeds of walking and running. Upper and lower boundaries to the total work were determined by including or excluding possible energy transfers between the segments of each limb, between the limbs and between the centre of mass of the body and the limbs. It appears that the muscle-tendon work of locomotion is most accurately measured when energy transfers are only included between segments of the same limb, but not among the limbs or between the limbs and the centre of mass of the whole body.},\n",
