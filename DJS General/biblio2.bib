abstract = {Over time, leg prostheses have improved in design, but have been incapable of actively adapting to different walking velocities in a manner comparable to a biological limb. People with a leg amputation using such commercially available passive-elastic prostheses require significantly more metabolic energy to walk at the same velocities, prefer to walk slower and have abnormal biomechanics compared with non-amputees. A bionic prosthesis has been developed that emulates the function of a biological ankle during level-ground walking, specifically providing the net positive work required for a range of walking velocities. We compared metabolic energy costs, preferred velocities and biomechanical patterns of seven people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the bionic prosthesis and using their own passive-elastic prosthesis to those of seven non-amputees during level-ground walking. Compared with using a passive-elastic prosthesis, using the bionic prosthesis decreased metabolic cost by 8 per cent, increased trailing prosthetic leg mechanical work by 57 per cent and decreased the leading biological leg mechanical work by 10 per cent, on average, across walking velocities of 0.75–1.75 m s−1 and increased preferred walking velocity by 23 per cent. Using the bionic prosthesis resulted in metabolic energy costs, preferred walking velocities and biomechanical patterns that were not significantly different from people without an amputation.},

abstract = {Characterizing the quasi-stiffness and work of lower extremity joints is critical for evaluating human locomotion and designing assistive devices such as prostheses and orthoses intended to emulate the biological behavior of human legs. This work aims to establish statistical models that allow us to predict the ankle quasi-stiffness and net mechanical work for adults walking on level ground. During the stance phase of walking, the ankle joint propels the body through three distinctive phases of nearly constant stiffness known as the quasi-stiffness of each phase. Using a generic equation for the ankle moment obtained through an inverse dynamics analysis, we identify key independent parameters needed to predict ankle quasi-stiffness and propulsive work and also the functional form of each correlation. These parameters include gait speed, ankle excursion, and subject height and weight. Based on the identified form of the correlation and key variables, we applied linear regression on experimental walking data for 216 gait trials across 26 subjects (speeds from 0.75-2.63 m/s) to obtain statistical models of varying complexity. The most general forms of the statistical models include all the key parameters and have an R(2) of 75{\%} to 81{\%} in the prediction of the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and propulsive work. The most specific models include only subject height and weight and could predict the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and work for optimal walking speed with average error of 13{\%} to 30{\%}. We discuss how these models provide a useful framework and foundation for designing subject- and gait-specific prosthetic and exoskeletal devices designed to emulate biological ankle function during level ground walking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dynamic stiffness can be used for studying foot pathologic abnormalities and for developing prostheses and orthoses. Although previous works have studied the role of ankle joint stiffness during gait, other foot joints have not yet been analyzed. We sought to characterize the dynamic stiffness of the ankle, midtarsal, and metatarsophalangeal joints during normal walking. METHODS Kinematics and contact data from four healthy individuals during walking were registered with a three-dimensional motion analysis system and a pressure platform. Stance phases with flexion moment-angle linear relationships were identified, and dynamic stiffnesses were calculated from the slope of their linear regressions. Intraparticipant repeatability was analyzed using analyses of variance, and interparticipant variability was checked through the SD of averaged participant stiffnesses. RESULTS Flexion moment-angle linear relationships were identified (R(2) {\textgreater}0.98) during the early and late midstance phases and the propulsion phase at the ankle (2.76, 5.23, and 3.42 N{\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad, respectively) and midtarsal (15.88, 3.90, and 4.64 N{\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad, respectively) joints. At the metatarsophalangeal joint, a linear relationship (R(2) {\textgreater}0.96) occurred only during the propulsion phase (0.11 N{\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad). High dynamic stiffness variability was observed during the late and early midstance phases at the ankle and midtarsal joints, respectively. CONCLUSIONS These results may serve as a basis for future studies aimed at investigating the role of dynamic stiffness identified herein in different foot disorders. The importance of properly controlling the samples in such studies is highlighted. Study of the dynamic stiffnesses identified might be used in the design of prostheses, orthoses, and other assistive devices.},

abstract = {High- (HA) and low-arched (LA) athletes have an exaggerated risk of injury. Ankle joint stiffness is a potential underlying mechanism for the greater rate of injury within these two functionally different groups. An alternative candidate mechanism of injury in HA and LA athletes pertains to the efficacy of the foot as a rigid lever during propulsion. The purpose of this study was to quantify the differences in ankle dynamic joint stiffness, and ankle braking work and ankle propulsive work during stance phase of running. Methods: Ten HA and ten LA athletes performed five barefoot running trials while ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics were recorded. Ankle dynamic joint stiffness was calculated as the slope of the ankle joint moment-ankle joint angle plot during load attenuation. Ankle braking and propulsive work values were calculated for the stance phase. Results: HA athletes had significantly greater ankle dynamic joint stiffness and significantly smaller ankle net and propulsive work than LA athletes. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that HA and LA athletes exhibit unique biomechanical patterns during running. These patterns may be related to lower extremity injury. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize and compare dynamic joint stiffness (DJS) of the ankle in the sagittal plane during natural cadence walking in both genders.

DESIGN: Observation, cross-sectional and matched pairs.

PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one males (mean age=27+/-4.2 years) and 18 females (mean age=22.9+/-4.1 years).

SETTING: Laboratory at the University de Tr{\'{a}}s-os-Montes and Alto Douro. The DJS of the ankle was assessed while participants performed barefoot walking at a natural cadence, was measured using a force platform (1000 Hz), and synchronized with a high-speed camera (200 Hz).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DJS of the ankle in males and females was calculated in two sub-phases (the second and the fourth sub-phases) of the stance phase. The Wilcoxon non-parametric matched-pairs test and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test were used to analyse difference of DJS of the ankle within and between the groups with p0.05 regarded as significant.

RESULTS: Male and female participants demonstrated significantly (p{\textless}0.005) less DJS during the second sub-phase. DJS was not significantly (p{\textgreater}0.063) different between females (0.0511 N m/kg/ degrees ) and males (0.0596 N m/kg/ degrees ) during the second sub-phase. DJS was significantly (p{\textless}0.001) higher in males (0.0844 N m/kg/ degrees ) than females (0.0691 N m/kg/ degrees ) during the fourth sub-phase.

CONCLUSIONS: Gender-specific DJS characteristics demonstrated by females in this study may be used in preventative training programs designed to promote a greater ability to use contractile components to produce mechanical energy through the ankle.},

abstract = {Aim of this study was to provide a non-invasive assessment of the dynamic properties of the ankle joint during human locomotion, with specific focus on the effects of gender and age. Accordingly, flexion-extension angles and moments, obtained through gait analysis, were used to generate moment-angle loops at the ankle joint in 120 healthy subjects walking at a same normalized speed. Four reproducible types of loops were identified: Typical Loops, Narrow, Large and Yielding loops. No significant changes in the slopes of the main loop phases were observed as a function of gender and age, with the exception of a relative increase in the slope of the descending phase in elderly males compared to adult females. As for the ergometric parameters, the peak ankle moment, work produced and net work along the cycle were slightly, but significantly affected, with progressively decrease in the following order: Adult Males, Adult Females, Elderly Males and Elderly Females. The evidence that only few of the quantitative aspects of moment-angle loops were affected suggests that the control strategy which regulates the biomechanical properties of the ankle joint during walking is rather robust and qualitatively consistent across genders and age.},

abstract = {The non-disabled human ankle joint was examined during walking in an attempt to determine overall system characteristics for use in the design of ankle prostheses. The hypothesis of the study was that the quasi-stiffness of the ankle changes when walking at different walking speeds. The hypothesis was examined using sagittal plane ankle moment versus ankle angle curves from 24 able-bodied subjects walking over a range of speeds. The slopes of the moment versus ankle angle curves (quasi-stiffness) during loading appeared to change as speed was increased and the relationship between the moment and angle during loading became increasingly non-linear. The loading and unloading portions of the moment versus angle curves showed clockwise loops (hysteresis) at self-selected slow speeds that reduced essentially to zero as the speed increased to self-selected normal speeds. Above self-selected normal speeds, the loops started to traverse a counter-clockwise path that increased in area as the speed was increased. These characteristics imply that the human ankle joint could be effectively replaced with a rotational spring and damper for slow to normal walking speeds. However, to mimic the characteristics of the human ankle during walking at fast speeds, an augmented system would be necessary. This notion is supported by the sign of the ankle power at the time of opposite heel contact, which was negative for slow speeds, was near zero at normal speeds, and was positive for fast walking speeds. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Ankle characteristics vary in terms of gait phase and speed change. This study aimed to quantify the components of ankle characteristics, including quasi-stiffness and work in different gait phases and at various speeds. Methods: The kinetic and kinematic data of 20 healthy participants were collected during normal gait at four speeds. Stance moment-angle curves were divided into three sub-phases including controlled plantarflexion, controlled dorsiflexion and powered plantarflexion. The slope of the moment-angle curves was quantified as quasi-stiffness. The area under the curves was defined as work. Results: The lowest quasi-stiffness was observed in the controlled plantarflexion. The fitted line to moment-angle curves showed R 2 {\textgreater} 0.8 at controlled dorsiflexion and powered plantarflexion. Quasi-stiffness was significantly different at different speeds (P = 0.00). In the controlled dorsiflexion, the ankle absorbed energy; by comparison, energy was generated in the powered plantarflexion. A negative work value was recorded at slower speeds and a positive value was observed at faster speeds. Ankle peak powers were increased with walking speed (P = 0.00). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the quasi-stiffness and work of the ankle joint can be regulated at different phases and speeds. These findings may be clinically applicable in the design and development of ankle prosthetic devices that can naturally replicate human walking at various gait speeds.},

abstract = {Moment-angle relationship (dynamic joint stiffness) - the relationship between changes in joint moment and changes in joint angle - is useful for demonstrating interaction of kinematics and kinetics during gait. However, the individual contributors of dynamic joint stiffness are not well studied and understood, which has thus far limited its clinical application. In this study, ankle dynamic joint stiffness was analyzed and decomposed into three components in thirty able-bodied children during the stance phase of the gait. To verify the accuracy of the decomposition, the sum of decomposed components was compared to stiffness computed from experimental data, and good to very good agreement was found. Component 1, the term associated with changes in ground reaction force moment, was the dominant contribution to ankle dynamic joint stiffness. Retrospective data from eight children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and idiopathic toe-walking was examined to explore the potential utility of analytical decomposition in pathological gait. Compared to controls, component 1 was the source of highest deviation in both pathological groups. Specifically, ankle dynamic joint stiffness differences can be further identified via two sub-components of component 1 which are based on magnitudes and rates of change of the ground reaction force and of its moment arm, and differences between the two patient groups and controls were most evident and interpretable here. Findings of the current study indicate that analytical decomposition can help identify the individual contributors to joint stiffness and clarify the sources of differences in patient groups. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Human gait provides a way of locomotion by combined efforts of the brain, nerves, and muscles. Conventionally, the human gait has been considered subjectively through visual observations but now with advanced technology, human gait analysis can be done objec-tively and empirically for the better quality of life. In this paper, the literature of the past survey on gait analysis has been discussed. This is followed by discussion on gait analysis methods. Vision-based human motion analysis has the potential to provide an inexpensive, non-obtrusive solution for the estimation of body poses. Data parameters for gait analy-sis have been discussed followed by preprocessing steps. Then the implemented machine learning techniques have been discussed in detail. The objective of this survey paper is to present a comprehensive analysis of contemporary gait analysis.

abstract = {The need to share gait analysis data to improve clinical decision support has been recognised since the early 1990s. GaitaBase has been established to provide a web-accessible repository system of gait analysis data to improve the sharing of data across local and international clinical and research community. It is used by several clinical and research groups across the world providing cross-group access permissions to retrieve and analyse the data. The system is useful for bench-marking and quality assurance, clinical consultation, and collaborative research. It has the capacity to increase the population sample size and improve the quality of 'normative' gait data. In addition the accumulated stored data may facilitate clinicians in comparing their own gait data with others, and give a valuable insight into how effective specific interventions have been for others. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {—Large-scale human motion databases are key for re-search questions ranging from human motion analysis and synthe-sis, biomechanics of human motion, data-driven learning of motion primitives, and rehabilitation robotics to the design of humanoid robots and wearable robots such as exoskeletons. In this paper we present a large-scale database of whole-body human motion with methods and tools, which allows a unifying representation of cap-tured human motion, and efficient search in the database, as well as the transfer of subject-specific motions to robots with differ-ent embodiments. To this end, captured subject-specific motion is normalized regarding the subject's height and weight by using a reference kinematics and dynamics model of the human body, the master motor map (MMM). In contrast with previous approaches and human motion databases, the motion data in our database con-sider not only the motions of the human subject but the position and motion of objects with which the subject is interacting as well. In addition to the description of the MMM reference model, we present procedures and techniques for the systematic recording, labeling, and organization of human motion capture data, object motions as well as the subject–object relations. To allow efficient search for certain motion types in the database, motion recordings are manually annotated with motion description tags organized in a tree structure. We demonstrate the transfer of human motion to humanoid robots and provide several examples of motion analysis using the database.},

abstract = {The ankle contributes the majority of mechanical power during walking and is a frequently studied joint in biomechanics. Specifically, researchers have extensively investigated the torque-angle relationship for the ankle during dynamic tasks, such as walking and running. The slope of this relationship has been termed the "quasi-stiffness." However, over time, researchers have begun to interchange the concepts of quasi-stiffness and stiffness. This is an especially important distinction as researchers currently begin to investigate the appropriate control systems for recently developed powered prosthetic legs. The quasi-stiffness and stiffness are distinct concepts in the context of powered joints, and are equivalent in the context of passive joints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the difference between the stiffness and quasi-stiffness using a simple impedance-controlled inverted pendulum model and a more sophisticated biped walking model, each with the ability to modify the trajectory of an impedance controller's equilibrium angle position. In both cases, stiffness values are specified by the controller and the quasi-stiffness are shown during a single step. Both models have widely varying quasi-stiffness but each have a single stiffness value. Therefore, from this simple modeling approach, the differences and similarities between these two concepts are elucidated.},

abstract = {Dimensionless analysis ensures that differences in sizes (e.g. height and weight) of children have a minimal influence on gait parameters. The results of changes in speed on gait parameters were examined using dimensionless analysis on data from a prospective 5-year study of 16 children. Linear regression analysis of peak and trough values of temporal distance parameters, ground reaction forces, joint angles, moments and powers provide a quantitative description of gait development with normalised speed. These linear relationships can be used to estimate gait parameters from speed measurements for normal subjects. However, caution is advised in using the data to attempt to predict an individual's gait parameters due to the wide spread of data about the regression lines and we do not recommend that the data be used to extrapolate the regression data to wider speed ranges. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Schwartz2008,
abstract = {This article describes a new multivariate measure of overall gait pathology called the Gait Deviation Index (GDI). The first step in developing the GDI was to use kinematic data from a large number of walking strides to derive a set of mutually independent joint rotation patterns that efficiently describe gait. These patterns are called gait features. Linear combinations of the first 15 gait features produced a 98{\%} faithful reconstruction of both the data from which they were derived and 1000 validation strides not used in the derivation. The GDI was then defined as a scaled distance between the 15 gait feature scores for a subject and the average of the same 15 gait feature scores for a control group of typically developing (TD) children. Concurrent and face validity data for the GDI are presented through comparisons with the Gillette Gait Index (GGI), Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire Walking Scale (FAQ), and topographic classifications within the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy (CP). The GDI and GGI are strongly correlated (r2= 0.56). The GDI scales with FAQ level, distinguishes levels from one another, and is normally distributed across FAQ levels six to ten and among TD children. The GDI also scales with respect to clinical involvement based on topographic CP classification in Hemiplegia Types I-IV, Diplegia, Triplegia and Quadriplegia. The GDI offers an alternative to the GGI as a comprehensive quantitative gait pathology index, and can be readily computed using the electronic addendum provided with this article. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Bovi2011a,
abstract = {Standard clinical gait analysis protocols usually limit to test self-selected speed gait: this approach is generally valid and permits time and cost saving. Yet, the literature evidences suggest that some pathologies (especially at onset or subclinical level) may not primarily affect plain gait, but more demanding locomotor tasks. In the present study we therefore propose a multiple-task gait analysis protocol including: self-selected, increased and decreased speed gait; walking on toes; walking on heels; step ascending and step descending, and apply it to 40 healthy subjects (20 aged 6-17, 20 aged 22-72) thus building extensive reference data set. Published studies already report normative data for some of these tasks, but inhomogeneously (due to different collecting methods and biomechanical models, population characteristics, nature of data). We verify a good correlation between our results and those presented by Schwartz et al. (2008) [12] in their study providing extensive data on the effect of walking speed on the gait of healthy children. In discussing the results, the rationale and effectiveness of each task is confirmed, and we supply an electronic addendum with comprehensive kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic normative data for the considered population, along with a set of reference parameters and related statistical analysis, as a premise for further applications on pathological subjects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Numerous gait event detection (GED) algorithms have been developed using accelerometers as they allow the possibility of long-term gait analysis in everyday life. However, almost all such existing algorithms have been developed and assessed using data collected in controlled indoor experiments with pre-defined paths and walking speeds. On the contrary, human gait is quite dynamic in the real-world, often involving varying gait speeds, changing surfaces and varying surface inclinations. Though portable wearable systems can be used to conduct experiments directly in the real-world, there is a lack of publicly available gait datasets or studies evaluating the performance of existing GED algorithms in various real-world settings. This paper presents a new gait database called MAREA (n = 20 healthy subjects) that consists of walking and running in indoor and outdoor environments with accelerometers positioned on waist, wrist and both ankles. The study also evaluates the performance of six state-of-the-art accelerometer-based GED algorithms in different real-world scenarios, using the MAREA gait database. The results reveal that the performance of these algorithms is inconsistent and varies with changing environments and gait speeds. All algorithms demonstrated good performance for the scenario of steady walking in a controlled indoor environment with a combined median F1score of 0.98 for Heel-Strikes and 0.94 for Toe-Offs. However, they exhibited significantly decreased performance when evaluated in other lesser controlled scenarios such as walking and running in an outdoor street, with a combined median F1score of 0.82 for Heel-Strikes and 0.53 for Toe-Offs. Moreover, all GED algorithms displayed better performance for detecting Heel-Strikes as compared to Toe-Offs, when evaluated in different scenarios.},
