abstract = {Dynamic simulations of movement allow one to study neuromuscular coordination, analyze athletic performance, and estimate internal loading of the musculoskeletal system. Simulations can also be used to identify the sources of pathological movement and establish a scientific basis for treatment planning. We have developed a freely available, open-source software system (OpenSim) that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal structures and create dynamic simulations of a wide variety of movements. We are using this system to simulate the dynamics of individuals with pathological gait and to explore the biomechanical effects of treatments. OpenSim provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through a multi-institutional collaboration. Developing software that enables a concerted effort from many investigators poses technical and sociological challenges. Meeting those challenges will accelerate the discovery of principles that govern movement control and improve treatments for individuals with movement pathologies.},

abstract = {Impaired control of mediolateral body motion during walking is an important health concern. Developing treatments to improve mediolateral control is challenging, partly because the mechanisms by which muscles modulate mediolateral ground reaction force (and thereby modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center) during unimpaired walking are poorly understood. To investigate this, we examined mediolateral ground reaction forces in eight unimpaired subjects walking at four speeds and determined the contributions of muscles, gravity, and velocity-related forces to the mediolateral ground reaction force by analyzing muscle-driven simulations of these subjects. During early stance (0-6{\%} gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the leading foot was directed laterally and increased significantly (p{\textless}0.05) with walking speed. During early single support (14-30{\%} gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the stance foot was directed medially and increased significantly (p{\textless}0.01) with speed. Muscles accounted for more than 92{\%} of the mediolateral ground reaction force over all walking speeds, whereas gravity and velocity-related forces made relatively small contributions. Muscles coordinate mediolateral acceleration via an interplay between the medial ground reaction force contributed by the abductors and the lateral ground reaction forces contributed by the knee extensors, plantarflexors, and adductors. Our findings show how muscles that contribute to forward progression and body-weight support also modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center while weight is transferred from one leg to another during double support.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by slimming five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a new generation of manufacturing processes in which a part is fabricated by layer-by-layer addition of materials as opposed to traditional material removal processes or material deformation processes. The AM process creates parts directly from computer model without resorting to traditional tooling or numerical control programming. The AM technology has gained considerable recognition and adoption in various industry sectors ever since the first AM process (stereolithography) was introduced in late 1980s. Since then a variety of AM processes have been developed, which differ in the manner of creating and depositing layers, in the range of materials processed, and the extent of product quality, accuracy, and build speed. Initially, AM systems were commonly known as rapid prototyping systems because they were mainly aimed at producing physical prototypes in softer materials (such as polymer) for design and verification of new products. The physical prototypes could be produced by these systems rapidly compared with long lead times taken by traditional machining or molding processes. Now within a span of two decades, the AM has moved from prototyping stage to end-product manufacturing of real industrial parts in a variety of materials, both metals and nonmetals, spanning a wide range of applications in low volume or customized production. It should be noted that this technology has also been known by several other terms in published literature and books, such as rapid manufacturing, solid freeform fabrication, direct digital manufacturing, and more recently by just 3D printing in public media. AM is now the standard name adopted by American Society for Testing and Materials to represent this new generation of manufacturing technology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), colloquially known as 3D printing, is currently being promoted as the spark of a new industrial revolution. The technology allows one to make customized products without incurring any cost penalties in manufacturing as neither tools nor molds are required. Moreover, AM enables the production of complex and integrated functional designs in a one-step process, thereby also potentially reducing the need for assembly work. In this article, we discuss the impact of AM technology at both firm and industry level. Our intention is to discern how market structures will be affected from an operations management perspective. Based on an analysis of established economic models, we first identify the economic and technological characteristics of AM and distill four key principles relevant to manufacturers at firm level. We then critically assess the effects of AM at industry level by analyzing the validity of earlier assumptions in the models when these four principles apply. In so doing, we derive a set of seven propositions which provide impetus for future research. In particular, we propose that in a monopoly, the adoption of AM allows a firm to increase profits by capturing consumer surplus when flexibly producing customized products. Meanwhile in competitive markets, competition is spurred as AM may lower barriers to market entry and offers the ability to serve multiple markets at once. This should ultimately result in lower prices for consumers.},

The presentmanual corresponds to Elmer software version 6.0 forWindowsNT andUnix platforms. Lat- est documentations and programversions of Elmer are available (or links are provided) at http://www.csc.fi/elmer. Solving partial differential equation (PDE)modelswith the solver of Elmer requires that a precise description of the problemis given using the so-called solver input file, briefly referred to as the sif file. This file contains user-prepared input datawhich specify the location ofmesh files and control the selection of physicalmodels, material parameters, boundary conditions, initial conditions, stopping tolerances for iterative solvers, etc. In this chapter, the general structure of the file is described. We explain how the input data is organized into different sections and describe the general keyword syntax which is used in these sections to define the values of variousmodel parameters and to control the solution procedures. In the case of simple problem setups the solver input file may be written automatically by the prepro- cessor of Elmer software, so that knowing the solver input file format may be unnecessary. Creating a more complicated setup, or using keywords introduced by the user, however, requires the knowledge of the file format and keyword syntax. In the following the general structure of the input file is first illustrated by using simple examples,without trying to explain all possibilities in an exhaustive manner. We then describe the keyword syntax in more detail, showing also howmodel parameterswhose values depend on solution fields can be created. The later chapters of this manual, and Elmer Models Manual, which focuses on describing the PDE models Elmer can handle, provide more detailed material on specific issues.

abstract = {Unilateral below-knee amputees develop abnormal gait characteristics that include bilateral asymmetries and an elevated metabolic cost relative to non-amputees. In addition, long-term prosthesis use has been linked to an increased prevalence of joint pain and osteoarthritis in the intact leg knee. To improve amputee mobility, prosthetic feet that utilize elastic energy storage and return (ESAR) have been designed, which perform important biomechanical functions such as providing body support and forward propulsion. However, the prescription of appropriate design characteristics (e.g., stiffness) is not well-defined since its influence on foot function and important in vivo biomechanical quantities such as metabolic cost and joint loading remain unclear. The design of feet that improve these quantities could provide considerable advancements in amputee care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to couple design optimization with dynamic simulations of amputee walking to identify the optimal foot stiffness that minimizes metabolic cost and intact knee joint loading. A musculoskeletal model and distributed stiffness ESAR prosthetic foot model were developed to generate muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of amputee walking. Dynamic optimization was used to solve for the optimal muscle excitation patterns and foot stiffness profile that produced simulations that tracked experimental amputee walking data while minimizing metabolic cost and intact leg internal knee contact forces. Muscle and foot function were evaluated by calculating their contributions to the important walking subtasks of body support, forward propulsion and leg swing. The analyses showed that altering a nominal prosthetic foot stiffness distribution by stiffening the toe and mid-foot while making the ankle and heel less stiff improved ESAR foot performance by offloading the intact knee during early to mid-stance of the intact leg and reducing metabolic cost. The optimal design also provided moderate braking and body support during the first half of residual leg stance, while increasing the prosthesis contributions to forward propulsion and body support during the second half of residual leg stance. Future work will be directed at experimentally validating these results, which have important implications for future designs of prosthetic feet that could significantly improve amputee care.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Blast-related extremity trauma represents a serious challenge because of the extent of bone and soft tissue damage. Fragmentation and blast injuries account for 56{\%} of all injuries produced within the Iraqi and Afghan theaters where, as of July 2009, 723 combatants have sustained lower extremity limb loss. If limb salvage is not practical, or fails, then amputation should be considered. Amputation can be a reliable means toward pain relief and improvement of function. Optimizing functional outcome is paramount when deciding on definitive amputation level. Preservation of joint function improves limb biomechanics in many cases. Increased limb length also allows for the benefits associated with articular and distal limb proprioception. Amputees with improved lower extremity function also usually exhibit less energy consumption. Function and length are generally directly correlated, whereas energy consumption and length are inversely related. This article discusses the surgical principles of lower extremity amputation and postoperative management of amputees, and the various prosthetic options available.},

abstract = {This paper considers dimensional synthesis of a six-bar linkage with turning kinematic pairs, in the literature known as Stephenson III Six-bar linkage. The synthesis procedure started from the requirement that it should be a double dwell mechanism and that the coupler point, during dwell, should pass through the given points belonging to the circular arc. The coordinates of those points are not directly given; they lie on the circular arc defined by the corresponding centre of the curve and the crank angle that corresponds to the circular arc of the path during dwell. These values are obtained at the end of the optimization procedure so that in this case the precision points change their positions with the change of the position of the arc on which they lie. As this is the case with double dwell, the coupler point should describe a curve containing two circular arcs which does not have to be symmetric. A new metaheuristic algorithm, known as Cuckoo Search (CS), was used in the procedure of optimum synthesis of mechanism parameters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate whether contact times, as recorded by pedobarographic systems during quadrupedal and bipedal walking of bonobos, can be used to reliably calculate actual velocities, by applying formulae based on lateral-view video recordings. Secondly, we investigate the effect of speed on peak plantar pressures during bipedal and quadrupedal walking of the bonobo. Data were obtained from 4 individuals from a group of bonobos at the Animal Park Planckendael. From our study, we can conclude that both walking speeds calculated from contact times and lower leg length or simply from recorded contact times are good estimators for walking speed, when direct observation of the latter is impossible. Further, it was found that effects of speed on peak plantar pressures and vertical forces are absent or at least subtle in comparison to a large variation in pressure patterns. In bonobos, the same pressure patterns are used at all walking speeds, and, in consequence, we do not expect major changes in foot function.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by slimming five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess performance of life habits among persons with lower-limb amputation at admission, at discharge, and 3 months after rehabilitation discharge and describe their prosthetic profile at discharge and follow-up.

DESIGN: Case series.

SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation.

PARTICIPANTS: Unilateral persons with lower-limb amputation (N=19; 14 men; mean age, 53.4+/-14.6y).

INTERVENTION: Interdisciplinary rehabilitation.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life habits performance and prosthetic profile.

RESULTS: In the daily activities subdomain, the lowest performances were observed for mobility and housing at all evaluation times. Within the social role subdomain, employment, recreation, and community life scores were the lowest for the 3 evaluations. Mean scores for all activities of daily living subdomain categories significantly increased (P{\textless}.05) during rehabilitation except for personal care and communication. Only community life (social roles subdomain) significantly increased during rehabilitation; life habits remained unchanged after discharge. Fifty-eight percent of patients at discharge versus 68.4{\%} at follow-up used their prosthesis for more than 9 hours a day, and this increased significantly postdischarge (P=.017). Locomotor capability with prosthesis was similarly high at discharge and follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with lower-limb amputation, social role life habits appear to be more disturbed than those associated with activities of daily living. At discharge, prosthetic wear and locomotor capabilities with prosthesis were high and tended to improve on return to the community.},

abstract = {The subject of this thesis is the application of the dynamic walking approach to human gait. This work is motivated by the needs of persons with disabilities and by a desire to expand basic understanding of human walking. We address human gait from the perspective of dynamic walking, a theoretical approach to legged locomotion which emphasizes the use of simple dynamical models and focuses on behavior over the course of many steps rather than within a single step. We build on results from prior dynamic walking research and develop new areas of exploration, with energetics and stability providing context. We focus on three areas: improvement of prosthetic foot design, the function of arm swinging, and evaluation of balance among the elderly. These issues are addressed by use of dynamic walking models and controlled human subject experiments. We propose a Controlled Energy Storage and Return (CESR) foot prosthesis to increase push-off work and reduce energy expenditure in amputees, and tested a prototype experimentally. To better understand the role of arms swinging in gait, we developed a simple dynamic walking model with free-swinging arms and performed human subject experiments in which subjects swung their arms in various ways. Finally, we studied the effects of aging on balance during walking using a computational model and a human subject experiment in which younger and older adults walked overground for hundreds of consecutive steps. These models and experiments each expand our understanding of the fundamentals of gait and indicate pathways toward assisting individuals with disabilities. Taken as a whole, this work emphasizes the utility of the dynamic walking approach.},

In the clinical routine, the gait analysis is the main element for iden- tifying pathological disorders, supporting the diagnosis and facilitating a proper follow up. Traditionally, this analysis aims to establish the set of patterns that describe the dynamics of the system. However, this analysis is insufficient for some movements, especially for early stages of almost every pathological movement. The development of normal and pathological models has allowed to demostrate objective differences for each of these situations. In this article we present a summary of the models that describe the dynamics of the normal and pathological human gait, inspired by the morpho-physiology of the locomotor system. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of the effectiveness of the proposed models in the literature. Key},

abstract = {Although many studies have been carried out on prosthetic gait, the main parameters of below-knee amputee (BKA) gait are still poorly understood. The majority of the gait studies of amputees have focused on the temporal and distance variables, whereas kinetics of the gait may reveal more important information. The purpose of this study was to assess the prosthetic gait of transtibial amputees and compare it with the findings of other studies on BKA and able-bodied persons. Five male unilateral traumatic BKA between the ages of 32 and 77 years were tested. Ground reaction force data were combined with simultaneously recorded and subsequently digitized video data of coordinate motion to calculate joint kinetics data. The following variables were compared within the group and with those of nonamputees: linear velocity, relative angles, net moment, power, and work at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. The results of this study indicated that BKA perform a higher than normal hip extension, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion of the unaffected side, whereas having more than normal hip and knee flexion during stance on the affected side. It was also shown that amputees tend to generate little power during push-off of the prosthetic side. Major findings of this study confirmed that BKA perform an asymmetrical gait that is different from those of normal population.},

Additionally, collecting data on less prevalent amputations or on gait activities other than level walking and running on hard surfaces is rarely attempted. However, with the wealth of user-generated content on the Internet, the scope for collecting amputee gait data from alternative sources other than traditional gait labs is intriguing. Here we investigate the potential of YouTube videos to provide gait data on amputee walking. We use an example dataset of trans-femoral amputees level walking at self-selected speeds to collect temporal gait parameters and calculate gait asymmetry. We compare our YouTube data with typical literature values, and show that our methodology produces results that are highly comparable to data collected in a traditional manner. The similarity between the results of our novel methodology and literature values lends confidence to our technique. Nevertheless, clear challenges with the collection and interpretation of crowd-sourced gait data remain, including long term access to datasets, and a lack of validity and reliability studies in this area.},

abstract = {Background: Ankle characteristics vary in terms of gait phase and speed change. This study aimed to quantify the components of ankle characteristics, including quasi-stiffness and work in different gait phases and at various speeds. Methods: The kinetic and kinematic data of 20 healthy participants were collected during normal gait at four speeds. Stance moment-angle curves were divided into three sub-phases including controlled plantarflexion, controlled dorsiflexion and powered plantarflexion. The slope of the moment-angle curves was quantified as quasi-stiffness. The area under the curves was defined as work. Results: The lowest quasi-stiffness was observed in the controlled plantarflexion. The fitted line to moment-angle curves showed R 2 {\textgreater} 0.8 at controlled dorsiflexion and powered plantarflexion. Quasi-stiffness was significantly different at different speeds (P = 0.00). In the controlled dorsiflexion, the ankle absorbed energy; by comparison, energy was generated in the powered plantarflexion. A negative work value was recorded at slower speeds and a positive value was observed at faster speeds. Ankle peak powers were increased with walking speed (P = 0.00). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the quasi-stiffness and work of the ankle joint can be regulated at different phases and speeds. These findings may be clinically applicable in the design and development of ankle prosthetic devices that can naturally replicate human walking at various gait speeds.},

abstract = {AIM: To investigate mechanical work, efficiency, and antagonist muscle co-activation with a view to better understand the cause of the elevated metabolic cost of walking (C(W)) in older adults. METHODS: Metabolic, mechanical and electromyographic measurements were made as healthy young (YOU; n = 12, age = 27 +/- 3 years) and older (OLD; n = 20, age = 74 +/- 3 years) men of equivalent body mass and leg length walked on a treadmill at four speeds (ranging from 0.83 to 1.67 m s(-1)). RESULTS: Net (above resting) C(W), determined by indirect calorimetry was 31{\%} higher (average across speeds) in OLD (P {\textless} 0.05). The integrity of the passive pendulum like interchange of mechanical energies of the centre of mass (COM(B)), an energy-saving mechanism, was maintained in OLD. Furthermore, total mechanical work, determined from fluctuations in mechanical energy of COM(B) and of body segments relative to COM(B), was not significantly elevated in OLD. This resulted in a lower efficiency in OLD (-17{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05). Co-activation, temporally quantified from electromyography recordings, was 31{\%} higher in OLD for antagonist muscles of the thigh (P {\textless} 0.05). Thigh co-activation was moderately correlated with C(W) at three speeds (r = 0.38-0.52, P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Healthy septuagenarians with no gait impairment have an elevated C(W) which is not explained by an elevation in whole body mechanical work. Increased antagonist muscle co-activation (possibly an adaptation to ensure adequate joint stability) may offer partial explanation of the elevated C(W).},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Riener2002,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanics and motor co-ordination in humans during stair climbing at different inclinations. Ten normal subjects ascended and descended a five-step staircase at three different inclinations (24??, 30??, 42??). Three steps were instrumented with force sensors and provided 6 dof ground reactions. Kinematics was analysed by a camera-based optoelectronic system. An inverse dynamics approach was applied to compute joint moments and powers. The different kinematic and kinetic patterns of stair ascent and descent were analysed and compared to level walking patterns. Temporal gait cycle parameters and ground reactions were not significantly affected by staircase inclination. Joint angles and moments showed a relatively low but significant dependency on the inclination. A large influence was observed in joint powers. This can be related to the varying amount of potential energy that has to be produced (during ascent) or absorbed (during descent) by the muscles. The kinematics and kinetics of staircase walking differ considerably from level walking. Interestingly, no definite signs could be found indicating that there is an adaptation or shift in the motor patterns when moving from level to stair walking. This can be clearly seen in the foot placement: compared to level walking, the forefoot strikes the ground first-independent from climbing direction and inclination. This and further findings suggest that there is a certain inclination angle or angular range where subjects do switch between a level walking and a stair walking gait pattern.

abstract = {The elastic stretch-shortening cycle of the Achilles tendon during walking can reduce the active work demands on the plantarflexor muscles in series. However, this does not explain why or when this ankle work, whether by muscle or tendon, needs to be performed during gait. We therefore employ a simple bipedal walking model to investigate how ankle work and series elasticity impact economical locomotion. Our model shows that ankle elasticity can use passive dynamics to aid push-off late in single support, redirecting the body's center-of-mass (COM) motion upward. An appropriately timed, elastic push-off helps to reduce dissipative collision losses at contralateral heelstrike, and therefore the positive work needed to offset those losses and power steady walking. Thus, the model demonstrates how elastic ankle work can reduce the total energetic demands of walking, including work required from more proximal knee and hip muscles. We found that the key requirement for using ankle elasticity to achieve economical gait is the proper ratio of ankle stiffness to foot length. Optimal combination of these parameters ensures proper timing of elastic energy release prior to contralateral heelstrike, and sufficient energy storage to redirect the COM velocity. In fact, there exist parameter combinations that theoretically yield collision-free walking, thus requiring zero active work, albeit with relatively high ankle torques. Ankle elasticity also allows the hip to power economical walking by contributing indirectly to push-off. Whether walking is powered by the ankle or hip, ankle elasticity may aid walking economy by reducing collision losses.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for providing volitional control of a powered knee prosthesis during nonweight-bearing activity such as sitting. The method utilizes an impedance framework, such that the joint can be programmed with a given stiffness and damping that reflects the nominal impedance properties of an intact joint. Volitional movement of the knee joint is commanded via the stiffness set-point angle of the joint impedance, which is commanded by the user as a function of the measured surface electromyogram (EMG) from the hamstring and quadriceps muscles of the residual limb. Rather than using the respective EMG measurements from these muscles to directly command the flexion or extension set point of the knee, the presented approach utilizes a combination of quadratic discriminant analysis and principal component analysis to align the user's intent to flex or extend the knee joint with the pattern of measured EMG. The approach was implemented on three transfemoral amputees, and their ability to control knee movement was characterized by a set of knee joint trajectory tracking tasks. Each amputee subject also performed the same set of trajectory tracking tasks with his sound side (intact) knee joint. The average root mean square trajectory tracking errors of the prosthetic knee employing the EMG-based volitional control and the intact knee of the three subjects were 6.2° and 5.2°, respectively.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to characterize the manner in which net joint moments and non-muscular forces generate, absorb, and transfer mechanical energy during walking in able-bodied children. Standard gait data from seven healthy subjects between 6 and 17 years of age were combined with a dynamic model of the whole body to perform a power analysis based on induced acceleration techniques. These data were used to determine how each moment and force generates energy to, absorbs energy from, and transfers energy among the major body segments. The joint moments were found to induce transfers of mechanical energy between body segments that generally exceeded the magnitudes of energy generation and absorption. The amount of energy transferred by gravitational and velocity-dependent forces was considerably less than for the joint moments. The hip and ankle joint moments had relatively simple power patterns that tended to oppose each other, particularly over the stance phase. The knee joint moment had a more complex power pattern that appeared distinct from the hip and ankle moments. The general patterns of mechanical energy flow were similar to previous reports in adults. The approach described in this paper should provide a useful complement to standard clinical gait analysis procedures. {\textcopyright} 2012 IPEM.},

abstract = {Linear static response structural optimization has been developed fairly well by using the finite element method for linear static analysis. However, development is extremely slow for structural optimization where a non linear static analysis technique is required. Optimization methods using equivalent static loads (ESLs) have been proposed to solve various structural optimization disciplines. The disciplines include linear dynamic response optimization, structural optimization for multi-body dynamic systems, structural optimization for flexible multi-body dynamic systems, nonlinear static response optimization and nonlinear dynamic response optimization. The ESL is defined as the static load that generates the same displacement field by an analysis which is not linear static. An analysis that is not linear static is carried out to evaluate the displacement field. ESLs are evaluated from the displacement field, linear static response optimization is performed by using the ESLs, and the design is updated. This process proceeds in a cyclic manner. A variety of problems have been solved by the ESLs methods. In this paper, the methods are completely overviewed. Various case studies are demonstrated and future research of the methods is discussed.},

abstract = {The care and rehabilitation of individuals after lower limb amputation presents a substantial and growing socioeconomic challenge. Clinical outcome is closely linked to successful functional rehabilitation with a prosthetic limb, which depends upon comfortable prosthetic limb – residual limb load transfer. Despite early interest in the 1980s, the amputated limb has received considerably less attention in computational biomechanical analysis than other subjects, such as arthroplasty. This systematic literature review investigates the state of the art in residual limb finite element analysis published since 2000. The identified studies were grouped into the following categories: (1) residuum-prosthesis interface mechanics; (2) residuum soft tissue internal mechanics; (3) identification of residuum tissue characteristics; (4) proposals for incorporating FEA into the prosthesis fitting process; (5) analysis of the influence of prosthetic componentry concepts to improve load transfer to the residuum, such as the monolimb and structural socket compliance; and (6) analysis of osseointegrated (OI) prostheses. The state of the art is critically appraised in order to form recommendations for future modeling studies in terms of geometry, material properties, boundary conditions, interface models, and relevant but un-investigated issues. Finally, the practical implementation of these approaches is discussed.},

It has been developed using the 99 line code presented by Sigmund (Struct Multidisc Optim 21(2):120–127, 2001)asastart- ing point. The original code has been extended by a density filter, and a considerable improvement in efficiency has been achieved, mainly by preallocating arrays and vector- izing loops. A speed improvement with a factor of 100 is obtained for a benchmark example with 7,500 elements. Moreover, the length of the code has been reduced to a mere 88 lines. These improvements have been accomplished without sacrificing the readability of the code. The 88 line code can therefore be considered as a valuable successor to the 99 line code, providing a practical instrument that may help to ease the learning curve for those entering the field of topology optimization. The paper also discusses simple extensions of the basic code to include recent PDE-based and black-and-white projection filtering methods.

abstract = {Honeycomb structures have found numerous applications as structural and biomedical materials due to their favourable properties such as low weight, high stiffness, and porosity. Application of additive manufacturing and 3D printing techniques allows for manufacturing of honeycombs with arbitrary shape and wall thickness, opening the way for optimizing the mechanical and physical properties for specific applications. In this study, the mechanical properties of honeycomb structures with a new geometry, called octagonal honeycomb, were investigated using analytical, numerical, and experimental approaches. An additive manufacturing technique, namely fused deposition modelling, was used to fabricate the honeycomb from polylactic acid (PLA). The honeycombs structures were then mechanically tested under compression and the mechanical properties of the structures were determined. In addition, the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories were used for deriving analytical relationships for elastic modulus, yield stress, Poisson's ratio, and buckling stress of this new design of honeycomb structures. Finite element models were also created to analyse the mechanical behaviour of the honeycombs computationally. The analytical solutions obtained using Timoshenko beam theory were close to computational results in terms of elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and yield stress, especially for relative densities smaller than 25{\%}. The analytical solutions based on the Timoshenko analytical solution and the computational results were in good agreement with experimental observations. Finally, the elastic properties of the proposed honeycomb structure were compared to those of other honeycomb structures such as square, triangular, hexagonal, mixed, diamond, and Kagome. The octagonal honeycomb showed yield stress and elastic modulus values very close to those of regular hexagonal honeycombs and lower than the other considered honeycombs.},

abstract = {Background: In stroke and multiple sclerosis patients, gait is frequently hampered by a reduced ability to push-off with the ankle caused by weakness of the plantar-flexor muscles. To enhance ankle push-off and to decrease the high energy cost of walking, spring-like carbon-composite Ankle Foot Orthoses are frequently prescribed. However, it is unknown what Ankle Foot Orthoses stiffness should be used to obtain the most efficient gait. The aim of this simulation study was to gain insights into the effect of variation in Ankle Foot Orthosis stiffness on the amount of energy stored in the Ankle Foot Orthosis and the energy cost of walking. Methods: We developed a two-dimensional forward-dynamic walking model with a passive spring at the ankle representing the Ankle Foot Orthosis and two constant torques at the hip for propulsion. We varied Ankle Foot Orthosis stiffness while keeping speed and step length constant. Findings: We found an optimal stiffness, at which the energy delivered at the hip joint was minimal. Energy cost decreased with increasing energy storage in the ankle foot orthosis, but the most efficient gait did not occur with maximal energy storage. With maximum storage, push-off occurred too late to reduce the impact of the contralateral leg with the floor. Maximum return prior to foot strike was also suboptimal, as push-off occurred too early and its effects were subsequently counteracted by gravity. The optimal Ankle Foot Orthosis stiffness resulted in significant push-off timed just prior to foot strike and led to greater ankle plantar-flexion velocity just before contralateral foot strike. Interpretation: Our results suggest that patient energy cost might be reduced by the proper choice of Ankle Foot Orthosis stiffness},

abstract = {Running is a bouncing gait in which the body mass center slows and lowers during the first half of the stance phase; the mass center is then accelerated forward and upward into flight during the second half of the stance phase. Muscle-driven simulations can be analyzed to determine how muscle forces accelerate the body mass center. However, muscle-driven simulations of running at different speeds have not been previously developed, and it remains unclear how muscle forces modulate mass center accelerations at different running speeds. Thus, to examine how muscles generate accelerations of the body mass center, we created three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations of ten subjects running at 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0m/s. An induced acceleration analysis determined the contribution of each muscle to mass center accelerations. Our simulations included arms, allowing us to investigate the contributions of arm motion to running dynamics. Analysis of the simulations revealed that soleus provides the greatest upward mass center acceleration at all running speeds; soleus generates a peak upward acceleration of 19.8m/s2 (i.e., the equivalent of approximately 2.0 bodyweights of ground reaction force) at 5.0m/s. Soleus also provided the greatest contribution to forward mass center acceleration, which increased from 2.5m/s2 at 2.0m/s to 4.0m/s2 at 5.0m/s. At faster running speeds, greater velocity of the legs produced larger angular momentum about the vertical axis passing through the body mass center; angular momentum about this vertical axis from arm swing simultaneously increased to counterbalance the legs. We provide open-access to data and simulations from this study for further analysis in OpenSim at simtk.org/home/nmbl{\_}running, enabling muscle actions during running to be studied in unprecedented detail. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is a growing concern in today's mechatronic designs. In recent years, many works have emerged presenting energy-efficient actuators with electrical motors. However, there is little consistency in the way energy consumption is calculated. Drive inertia, motor efficiency and controller efficiency are often neglected in optimizations, and so are the load- and speed-dependency of the losses and other non-linearities. While this approach works well in stationary circumstances, it can lead to significant errors in highly dynamic tasks with a wide range of operation, such as the ones faced by actuators in the field of robotics. This paper discusses the losses occurring in an actuator consisting of a DC motor and gearbox as it is forcing a swinging motion on a pendulum. From this simple case study, some general recommendations on the modeling of energy losses are formulated. Combining data from manufacturer's datasheets with empirical data, the approach presented in this paper was able to predict the energy consumption for this specific case with an error of less than 10{\%}.},

abstract = {The cyclic and often linear torque-angle relationship of locomotion presents the opportunity to innovate on the design of traditional series-elastic actuators (SEAs). In this paper, a novel modification to the SEA architecture was proposed by adding a clutch in parallel with the motor within the SEA--denoted as a CSEA. This addition permits bimodal dynamics where the system is characterized by an SEA when the clutch is disengaged and a passive spring when the clutch is engaged. The purpose of the parallel clutch was to provide the ability to store energy in a tuned series spring, while requiring only reactionary torque from the clutch. Thus, when the clutch is engaged, a tuned elastic relationship can be achieved with minimal electrical energy consumption. The state-based model of the CSEA is introduced and the implementation of the CSEA mechanism in a powered knee prosthesis is detailed. The series elasticity was optimized to fit the spring-like torque-angle relationship of early stance phase knee flexion and extension during level ground walking. In simulation, the CSEA knee required 70{\%} less electrical energy than a traditional SEA. Future work will focus on the mechanical implementation of the CSEA knee and an empirical demonstration of reduced electrical energy consumption during walking.},

However, the complex nonlinear dynamics of the PAM manipulator makes it a challenging and appealing system for modeling and control design. The problems with the time variance, compliance, high hysteresis and nonlinearity of pneumatic systems have made it difficult to realize precise position control with high speed. In order to realize satisfactory control performance, the effect of nonlinear factors contained in thePAM manipulator must be considered. The purpose of this study is to improve the control performance of thePAM manipulator using a nonlinearPID controller. Superb mixture of conventionalPID controller and the neural network, which has powerful capability of learning, adaptation and tackling nonlinearity, brings us a novel nonlinearPID controller using neural network. This proposed controller is appropriate for a kind of plants with nonlinearity uncertainties and disturbances. The experiments were carried out in practicalPAM manipulator and the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm was demonstrated through the experiments, which suggests its superior performance and disturbance rejection.},

abstract = {File swarming (or file sharing) is one of the most important applications in P2P networks. In this paper, we propose a stochastic framework to analyze a file-swarming system under realistic setting: constraints in upload/download capacity, collaboration among peers and incentive for chunk exchange. We first extend the results in the coupon system [L. Massoulie, M. Vojnovic, Coupon replication systems, in: Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS, Banff, Alberta, Canada, 2005] by providing a tighter performance bound. Then we generalize the coupon system by considering peers with limited upload and download capacity. We illustrate the last-piece problem and show the effectiveness of using forward error-correction (FEC) code and/or multiple requests to improve the performance. Lastly, we propose a framework to analyze an incentive-based file-swarming system. The stochastic framework we propose can serve as a basis for other researchers to analyze and design more advanced features of file-swarming systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigated how the human lower-limb joints modulate work and power during walking and running on level ground. Experimental data were recorded from seven participants for a broad range of steady-state locomotion speeds (walking at 1.59±0.09 m s(-1) to sprinting at 8.95±0.70 m s(-1)). We calculated hip, knee and ankle work and average power (i.e. over time), along with the relative contribution from each joint towards the total (sum of hip, knee and ankle) amount of work and average power produced by the lower limb. Irrespective of locomotion speed, ankle positive work was greatest during stance, whereas hip positive work was greatest during swing. Ankle positive work increased with faster locomotion until a running speed of 5.01±0.11 m s(-1), where it plateaued at ∼1.3 J kg(-1). In contrast, hip positive work during stance and swing, as well as knee negative work during swing, all increased when running speed progressed beyond 5.01±0.11 m s(-1). When switching from walking to running at the same speed (∼2.0 m s(-1)), the ankle's contribution to the average power generated (and positive work done) by the lower limb during stance significantly increased from 52.7±10.4{\%} to 65.3±7.5{\%} (P=0.001), whereas the hip's contribution significantly decreased from 23.0±9.7{\%} to 5.5±4.6{\%} (P=0.004). With faster running, the hip's contribution to the average power generated (and positive work done) by the lower limb significantly increased during stance (P{\textless}0.001) and swing (P=0.003). Our results suggest that changing locomotion mode and faster steady-state running speeds are not simply achieved via proportional increases in work and average power at the lower-limb joints.},

To be practically implemented, such a mechanism must not only run on batteries, but sustain a long running time between recharging. Using springs to passively and actively store and supply energy to the robotic ankle, small DC motors can be optimized to perform high peak power tasks without sacrificing efficiency and net energy usage. Additional techniques are explored with the potential of substantially reducing the energy requirements as well as the size and weight of the prosthesis. The benefits of adding a unidirectional parallel spring with a Robotic Tendon are weighed and the possibility of actively varying the lever arm at which the spring force is applied is analyzed. The different actuation methods are compared to determine which methods work best in different gait regimes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in function, performance, and preference between mechanical and microprocessor prosthetic knee control technologies.

DESIGN: A-B-A-B reversal design.

SETTING: Home, community, and laboratory environments.

PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one unilateral, transfemoral amputees.

INTERVENTION: Mechanical control prosthetic knee versus microprocessor control prosthetic knee (Otto Bock C-Leg).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stair rating, hill rating and time, obstacle course time, divided attention task accuracy and time, Amputee Mobility Predictor score, step activity, Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire score, Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score, self-reported frequency of stumbles and falls, and self-reported concentration required for ambulation.

RESULTS: Stair descent score, hill descent time, and hill sound-side step length showed significant (P{\textless}.01) improvement with the C-Leg. Users reported a significant (P{\textless}.05) decrease in frequency of stumbles and falls, frustration with falling, and difficulty in multitasking while using the microprocessor knee. Subject satisfaction with the C-Leg was significantly (P{\textless}.001) greater than the mechanical control prosthesis.

CONCLUSIONS: The study population showed improved performance when negotiating stairs and hills, reduced frequency of stumbling and falling, and a preference for the microprocessor control C-Leg as compared with the mechanical control prosthetic knee.},

abstract = {During level-ground walking, mechanical work from each leg is required to redirect and accelerate the center of mass. Previous studies show a linear correlation between net metabolic power and the rate of step-to-step transition work during level-ground walking with changing step lengths. However, correlations between metabolic power and individual leg power during step-to-step transitions while walking on uphill/downhill slopes and at different velocities are not known. This basic understanding of these relationships between metabolic demands and biomechanical tasks can provide important information for design and control of biomimetic assistive devices such as leg prostheses and orthoses. Thus, we compared changes in metabolic power and mechanical power during step-to-step transitions while nineteen subjects walked at seven slopes (0°, +/−3°, +/−6o, {\&} +/−9°) and three velocities (1.00, 1.25, {\&} 1.50m/s). A quadratic model explained more of the variance (R2 = 0.58-0.61) than a linear model (R2 = 0.37−0.52) between metabolic power and individual leg mechanical power during step-to-step transitions across all velocities. A quadratic model explained more of the variance (R2 = 0.57−0.76) than a linear model (R2 = 0.52−0.59) between metabolic power and individual leg mechanical power during step-to-step transitions at each velocity for all slopes, and explained more of the variance (R2 = 0.12−0.54) than a linear model (R2 = 0.07−0.49) at each slope for all velocities. Our results suggest it is important to consider the mechanical function of each leg in the design of biomimetic assistive devices aimed at reducing metabolic costs when walking at different slopes and velocities.},

@article{Sutherland2002,
abstract = {Kinematics is treated as a single topic in this manuscript and the emphasis is on early history, just as it was in Part I, Electromyography. Needless to say, neither kinematics nor electromyography, nor kinetics and energy (the latter to be included in Part III) are stand-alone components of clinical gait analysis. The only reason for this selective format is that it lessens my task to be able to write about one subject at a time. One of the consequences of this arbitrary separation is that some contributors, who have enriched more than one portion of clinical gait analysis, are highlighted only in the area in which they have contributed the most. I began with Kinesiological Electromyography in Part I because the earliest stirrings of the dream of clinical gait analysis were expressed in the development of KEMG (kinesiological electromyography). The early investigators realized that very little could be said about the dynamic action of muscles without KEMG. Next, in chronological order, came kinematics. I have been an active participant and eyewitness, and take full responsibility for attempting to write an early history at a time when most of the contributors are still alive. Ordinarily, history is written much later, in order to fully grasp the significance of individual contributions in the tapestry of the whole. As stated in Part I, Electromyography, the emphasis has been placed on the early history. The application of motion analysis to sports medicine, and sports medicine functional analysis, is covered only lightly here, and this should not be interpreted as minimizing its importance. The literature on this subject is now quite voluminous and it would not be possible to cover it adequately in this manuscript. Later historical writings may differ significantly and will hopefully give more recognition to pioneers in later generations: those physicians, engineers, physical therapists and kinesiologists who are lifting the level of clinical gait analysis and directing their energies in expanding clinical directions. It is hoped that this manuscript will prompt additional manuscripts, as well as letters to the editor of Gait and Posture on the content of this review paper.},

However, claims have been made recently that not only have the functional disadvantages been redressed, but today's sprint prostheses may provide a mechanical advantage over the human limb.

Most of the problems reported in specialized literature present differences in specifications such as lengths, units, materials among others. For instance, some articles propose the same proportions and geometrical shapes but different dimensions. Hence, the purpose of this benchmark is to unify geometrical and mechanical characteristics and load conditions, considering that the proposed problems must be realistic, in the sense that the units are in the International System and a real-world material and load conditions are used. The final benchmark integrates 13 problems for plane stress using ASTM A-36 steel.

abstract = {Machines and humans become mechanically coupled when lower limb amputees walk with powered prostheses, but these two control systems differ in adaptability. We know little about how they interact when faced with real-world physical demands (e.g. carrying loads). Here, we investigated how each system (i.e. amputee and powered prosthesis) responds to changes in the prosthesis mechanics and gravitational load. Five transfemoral amputees walked with and without load (i.e. weighted backpack) and a powered knee prosthesis with two pre-programmed controller settings (i.e. for load and no load). We recorded subjects' kinematics, kinetics, and perceived exertion. Compared to the no load setting, the load setting reduced subjects' perceived exertion and intact-limb stance time when they carried load. When subjects did not carry load, their perceived exertion and gait performance did not significantly change with controller settings. Our results suggest transfemoral amputees could benefit from load-adaptive powered knee controllers, and controller adjustments affect amputees more when they walk with (versus without) load. Further understanding of the interaction between powered prostheses, amputee users, and various environments may allow researchers to expand the utility of prostheses beyond simple environments (e.g. firm level ground without load) that represent only a subset of real-world environments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The technological advances that have been made in developing highly functional prostheses are promising for very active patients but we do not yet know whether they cause an increase in biomechanical load along with possibly negative consequences for pressure conditions in the socket. Therefore, this study monitored the socket pressure at specific locations of the stump when using a microprocessor-controlled adaptive prosthetic ankle under different walking conditions.

METHODS: Twelve unilateral transtibial amputees between 43 and 59 years of age were provided with the Proprio-Foot (Ossur) and underwent an instrumented 3D gait analysis in level, stair, and incline walking, including synchronous data capturing of socket pressure. Peak pressures and pressure time integrals (PTI) at three different locations were compared for five walking conditions with and without using the device's ankle adaptation mode.

FINDINGS: Highest peak pressures of 2.4 k Pa/kg were found for incline ascent at the calf muscle as compared to 2.1 k Pa/kg in level walking with large inter-individual variance. In stair ascent a strong correlation was found between maximum knee moment and socket pressure. The most significant pressure changes relative to level walking were seen in ramp descent anteriorly towards the stump end, with PTI values being almost twice as high as those in level walking. Adapting the angle of the prosthesis on stairs and ramps modified the pressure data such that they were closer to those in level walking.

INTERPRETATION: Pressure at the stump depends on the knee moments involved in each walking condition. Adapting the prosthetic ankle angle is a valuable means of modifying joint kinetics and thereby the pressure distribution at the stump. However, large inter-individual differences in local pressures underline the importance of individual socket fitting.},

abstract = {Sloped walking requires altered strategies for maintaining dynamic balance relative to level-ground walking, as evidenced by changes in sagittal-plane whole-body angular momentum (H) in able-bodied individuals. The ankle plantarflexor muscles are critical for regulating H, and functional loss of these muscles from transtibial amputation affects this regulation. However, it is unclear if a powered prosthesis, which more closely emulates intact ankle function than a passive energy-storage-and-return prosthesis, affects H differently during sloped walking. Therefore, our purpose was to investigate H in individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation when using powered and passive prostheses. Overall, the range of H was greater in people with a transtibial amputation relative to able-bodied individuals. On a −10° decline, individuals with amputation did not decrease H as much as able-bodied individuals, and had reduced prosthetic limb braking ground reaction forces and knee power absorption. On a +10° incline, individuals with amputation had a greater relative increase of H than able-bodied individuals, a more anterior placement of the prosthetic foot, and higher peak hip power generation. The powered prosthesis condition resulted in a smaller range of H during prosthetic stance relative to the passive condition, although it was still larger than able-bodied individuals. Our results suggest that prosthetic ankle power generation may help regulate dynamic balance during prosthetic stance, but alone is not sufficient for restoring H to that of able-bodied individuals on slopes. Contributions of knee extensor muscles and the biarticular gastrocnemius in regulating H on slopes should be further investigated.},

The aim wasto investigate joint contact forces (JCF) calculated by a musculoskeletal model in the intact side and to compare it with those of unimpaired subjects and to further elucidate in how far increased knee JCF are associated with increased frontal plane knee moments. A group of seven subjects with BK amputation and a group of ten unimpaired subjects were recruited for this study. Gait data were measured by 3D motion capture and force plates. OpenSim software was applied to calculate JCF. Maximum joint angles, ground reaction forces, and moments as well as time distance parameters were determined and compared between groups showing no significant differences, with some JCF components of knee and hip even being slightly smaller in subjects with BK compared to the reference group. This positive finding may be due to the selected ESAR foot. However, other beneficial factors may also have influenced this positive result such as the general good health status of the subjects or the thorough and proper fitting and alignment of the prosthesis.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The roots of Multiple Criteria Decision Making and Multiple Criteria Optimization were laid by Pareto at the end of the 19th century, and since then the discipline has prospered and grown, especially during the last three decades. Today, many decision support systems incorporate methods to deal with conflicting objectives. The foundation for such systems is a mathematical theory of optimization under multiple objectives. Since its beginnings, there have been a vast number of books, journal issues, papers and conferences that have brought the field to its present state. Despite this vast body of literature, there is no reliable guide to provide an access to this knowledge. Over the years, many literature surveys and bibliographies have been published. With the ever rapidly increasing rate of publications in the area and the development of subfields, these were mostly devoted to particular aspects of multicriteria optimization: Multiobjective Integer Programming, Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization, Vector Optimization, Multiobjective Evolutionary Methods, Applications of MCDM, MCDM Software, Goal Programming. Hence the need for a comprehensive overview of the literature in multicriteria optimization that could serve as a state of the art survey and guide to the vast amount of publications. Multiple Criteria Optimization: State of the Art Annotated Bibliographic Surveys is precisely this book. Experts in various areas of multicriteria optimization have contributed to the volume. The chapters in this book roughly follow a thread from most general to more specific. Some of them are about particular types of problems (Theory of Vector Optimization, Nonlinear Multiobjective Programming, Fuzzy Multiobjective Programming, Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization, Multicriteria Scheduling Problems), while the others are focused on multi-objective methodologies (Goal Programming, Interactive Methods, Evolutionary Algorithms, Data Envelopment Analysis). All contributing authors invested great effort to produce comprehensive overviews and bibliographies and to have references that are as precise as possible.},

abstract = {Lower-extremity amputees encounter a series of stress-related challenges. Among them is an increased risk of chronic joint disorders. For unilateral, transtibial amputees, we hypothesize that increasing the power output of the trailing, ankle-foot prosthesis during powered plantar flexion could mitigate kinetic loading applied to the leading, contralateral leg during walking. Here, we present a case series that analyzes kinetic factors of unilateral, transtibial amputee gait and forms a comparison between two types of ankle prostheses with varying power outputs. The factors examined here are impact resultant force, peak foot pressure at heel-strike, step-to-step transition work, and knee external adduction moment. The two prostheses are the amputee participant's daily-use passive ankle-foot prosthesis and the BiOM powered ankle-foot prosthesis capable of biologically accurate powered plantar flexion during late stance. In a preliminary study on two transtibial amputees walking over level terrain at a controlled speed (1.25 m/s), we observed average reductions of 8{\%} in peak impact resultant force, 18{\%} in impact resultant force loading rate, 8{\%} in peak heel-strike foot pressure, and 15{\%} in the 1(st) peak knee external adduction moment when the powered ankle-foot prosthesis was compared to the conventional passive prosthesis. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that more biomimetic prosthetic ankle-foot push-off during late stance may limit leading-leg musculoskeletal stress in walking.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the increased energy cost of amputee gait could be accounted for by an increase in the mechanical work dissipated during the step-to-step transition in walking. Eleven transtibial amputees (AMP) and 11 age-matched controls (CO) walked at both comfortable (CWS) and fixed (FWS, 1.3m/s) walking speed, while external mechanical work of each separate leg and metabolic energy consumption were measured. At FWS the metabolic energy consumption (E(met)) was significantly higher in AMP compared to CO (3.34 Jkg(-1)s(-1) vs. 2.73 Jkg(-1)s(-1)). At CWS, no difference in energy consumption was found (3.56 Jkg(-1)s(-1) vs. 3.58 Jkg(-1)s(-1)) but CWS was significantly lower in AMP compared to CO (1.35 ms(-1) vs. 1.52 ms(-1)). In conjunction with the higher E(met) at FWS, the negative work generated by the intact leading leg for the step-to-step transition in double support was significantly higher for AMP than CO at FWS. A moderate though significant correlation was found between negative mechanical power generated during the step-to-step transition and metabolic power (CWS: r=-0.56, p=0.007; FWS: r=-0.50, p=0.019). Despite the difference in negative work during the step-to-step transition, the total absolute mechanical work over a stride did not differ between groups. This could possibly be attributed to exchange of internal positive and negative work during single support, which remains unnoticed in the external work calculations. It was concluded that the increased mechanical work for the step-to-step transition from prosthetic to intact limb contributes to the increased metabolic energy cost of amputee walking.},

abstract = {Dynamic joint stiffness defines the dynamic relationship between the position of a joint and the torque acting about it and can be separated into intrinsic and reflex components. Under stationary conditions, these can be identified using a nonlinear parallel-cascade algorithm that models intrinsic stiffness-a linear dynamic response to position-and reflex stiffness-a nonlinear dynamic response to velocity-as parallel pathways. Experiments using this method show that both intrinsic and reflex stiffness depend strongly on the operating point, defined by position and torque, likely because of some underlying nonlinear behavior not modeled by the parallel-cascade structure. Consequently, both intrinsic and reflex stiffness will appear to be time-varying whenever the operating point changes rapidly, as during movement. This paper describes and validates an extension of the parallel-cascade algorithm to time-varying conditions. It describes the ensemble method used to estimate time-varying intrinsic and reflex stiffness. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can track rapid changes in joint stiffness accurately. Finally, the performance of the algorithm in the presence of noise is tested. We conclude that the new algorithm is a powerful new tool for the study of joint stiffness during functional tasks.},

abstract = {Muscles actuate walking by providing vertical support and forward progression of the mass center. To quantify muscle contributions to vertical support and forward progression (i.e., vertical and fore-aft accelerations of the mass center) over a range of walking speeds, three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulations of gait were generated and analyzed for eight subjects walking overground at very slow, slow, free, and fast speeds. We found that gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vasti, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus were the primary contributors to support and progression at all speeds. With the exception of gluteus medius, contributions from these muscles generally increased with walking speed. During very slow and slow walking speeds, vertical support in early stance was primarily provided by a straighter limb, such that skeletal alignment, rather than muscles, provided resistance to gravity. When walking speed increased from slow to free, contributions to support from vasti and soleus increased dramatically. Greater stance-phase knee flexion during free and fast walking speeds caused increased vasti force, which provided support but also slowed progression, while contralateral soleus simultaneously provided increased propulsion. This study provides reference data for muscle contributions to support and progression over a wide range of walking speeds and highlights the importance of walking speed when evaluating muscle function. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {The fixed neutral position of conventional prosthetic feet causes difficulties for transtibial amputees (TTAs) when walking on ramps. New microprocessor-controlled prosthetic ankles such as the Proprio-Foot (Ossur) aim to reduce these difficulties by modifying the prosthetic ankle angle according to the gait condition. The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the biomechanical effects of adaptation of the prosthetic ankle on ramp ambulation in TTAs. Sixteen TTAs and 16 controls underwent a conventional 3D gait analysis while walking up and down a ramp. TTAs walked with the prosthetic foot set to a neutral mode angle and set to the adapted mode. Norm distance, sagittal kinematics and kinetics were calculated for comparisons between TTAs and controls. During ramp ascent, the dorsiflexion brought about by the adapted prosthetic ankle reduced the increased knee extension noted on the TTAs' involved side and the increased plantarflexion on their sound side. During ramp descent, the plantarflexion of the adapted mode increased the adaptation mechanisms observed in TTAs. These findings suggest that the adapted mode leads to more physiologic kinematics and kinetics in the lower limbs in TTAs during ramp ascent but not during ramp descent. However, in the adapted mode, patients reported feeling safer during ramp descent, thus indicating that there might be other safety related measures such as toe-clearance or coefficient of friction influencing this perception.},

abstract = {The non-disabled human ankle joint was examined during walking in an attempt to determine overall system characteristics for use in the design of ankle prostheses. The hypothesis of the study was that the quasi-stiffness of the ankle changes when walking at different walking speeds. The hypothesis was examined using sagittal plane ankle moment versus ankle angle curves from 24 able-bodied subjects walking over a range of speeds. The slopes of the moment versus ankle angle curves (quasi-stiffness) during loading appeared to change as speed was increased and the relationship between the moment and angle during loading became increasingly non-linear. The loading and unloading portions of the moment versus angle curves showed clockwise loops (hysteresis) at self-selected slow speeds that reduced essentially to zero as the speed increased to self-selected normal speeds. Above self-selected normal speeds, the loops started to traverse a counter-clockwise path that increased in area as the speed was increased. These characteristics imply that the human ankle joint could be effectively replaced with a rotational spring and damper for slow to normal walking speeds. However, to mimic the characteristics of the human ankle during walking at fast speeds, an augmented system would be necessary. This notion is supported by the sign of the ankle power at the time of opposite heel contact, which was negative for slow speeds, was near zero at normal speeds, and was positive for fast walking speeds. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Gait analysis is the systematic study of human walking, using the eye and brain of experienced observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body movements, body mechanics and the activity of the muscles. In individuals with conditions affecting their ability to walk, gait analysis may be used to make detailed diagnoses and to plan optimal treatment. Over the past few years, gait analysis has ‘come of age' and in a number of centers it is now used routinely to provide the best possible care for certain groups of patients, most notably those with cerebral palsy. Since the benefits of this approach have been well established, it is to be hoped that its usage will continue to spread, so that many more will benefit from the better treatment decisions which can be made when gait analysis is used. I am happy to believe that the first three editions of this book have contributed to this process, by providing a text which does not require a high level of academic learning to be understood. I have heard from people all over the world that they have found the book useful and this I find very gratifying. The next stage in the evolution of gait analysis will hopefully involve improvements in the ease and speed with which gait data can be collected and interpreted, and decreases in the cost of the equipment and the skill level needed to use it. Significant strides have been made in all these aspects since the third edition of the book was published},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) have become a popular optimization tool for many areas of research and topology optimization an effective design tool for obtaining efficient and lighter structures. In this paper, a versatile, robust and enhanced GA is proposed for structural topology optimization by using problem-specific knowledge. The original discrete black-and-white (0-1) problem is directly solved by using a bit-array representation method. To address the related pronounced connectivity issue effectively, the four-neighbourhood connectivity is used to suppress the occurrence of checkerboard patterns. A simpler version of the perimeter control approach is developed to obtain a well-posed problem and the total number of hinges of each individual is explicitly penalized to achieve a hinge-free design. To handle the problem of representation degeneracy effectively, a recessive gene technique is applied to viable topologies while unusable topologies are penalized in a hierarchical manner. An efficient FEM-based function evaluation method is developed to reduce the computational cost. A dynamic penalty method is presented for the GA to convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem without the possible degeneracy. With all these enhancements and appropriate choice of the GA operators, the present GA can achieve significant improvements in evolving into near-optimum solutions and viable topologies with checkerboard free, mesh independent and hinge-free characteristics. Numerical results show that the present GA can be more efficient and robust than the conventional GAs in solving the structural topology optimization problems of minimum compliance design, minimum weight design and optimal compliant mechanisms design. It is suggested that the present enhanced GA using problem-specific knowledge can be a powerful global search tool for structural topology optimization.

abstract = {Numerous gait event detection (GED) algorithms have been developed using accelerometers as they allow the possibility of long-term gait analysis in everyday life. However, almost all such existing algorithms have been developed and assessed using data collected in controlled indoor experiments with pre-defined paths and walking speeds. On the contrary, human gait is quite dynamic in the real-world, often involving varying gait speeds, changing surfaces and varying surface inclinations. Though portable wearable systems can be used to conduct experiments directly in the real-world, there is a lack of publicly available gait datasets or studies evaluating the performance of existing GED algorithms in various real-world settings. This paper presents a new gait database called MAREA (n = 20 healthy subjects) that consists of walking and running in indoor and outdoor environments with accelerometers positioned on waist, wrist and both ankles. The study also evaluates the performance of six state-of-the-art accelerometer-based GED algorithms in different real-world scenarios, using the MAREA gait database. The results reveal that the performance of these algorithms is inconsistent and varies with changing environments and gait speeds. All algorithms demonstrated good performance for the scenario of steady walking in a controlled indoor environment with a combined median F1score of 0.98 for Heel-Strikes and 0.94 for Toe-Offs. However, they exhibited significantly decreased performance when evaluated in other lesser controlled scenarios such as walking and running in an outdoor street, with a combined median F1score of 0.82 for Heel-Strikes and 0.53 for Toe-Offs. Moreover, all GED algorithms displayed better performance for detecting Heel-Strikes as compared to Toe-Offs, when evaluated in different scenarios.},

abstract = {The human ankle varies impedance and delivers net positive work during the stance period of walking. In contrast, commercially available ankle-foot prostheses are passive during stance, causing many clinical problems for transtibial amputees, including non-symmetric gait patterns, higher gait metabolism, and poorer shock absorption. In this investigation, we develop and evaluate a myoelectric-driven, finite state controller for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that modulates both impedance and power output during stance. The system employs both sensory inputs measured local to the external prosthesis, and myoelectric inputs measured from residual limb muscles. Using local prosthetic sensing, we first develop two finite state controllers to produce biomimetic movement patterns for level-ground and stair-descent gaits. We then employ myoelectric signals as control commands to manage the transition between these finite state controllers. To transition from level-ground to stairs, the amputee flexes the gastrocnemius muscle, triggering the prosthetic ankle to plantar flex at terminal swing, and initiating the stair-descent state machine algorithm. To transition back to level-ground walking, the amputee flexes the tibialis anterior muscle, triggering the ankle to remain dorsiflexed at terminal swing, and initiating the level-ground state machine algorithm. As a preliminary evaluation of clinical efficacy, we test the device on a transtibial amputee with both the proposed controller and a conventional passive-elastic control. We find that the amputee can robustly transition between the finite state controllers through direct muscle activation, allowing rapid transitioning from level-ground to stair walking patterns. Additionally, we find that the proposed finite state controllers result in a more biomimetic ankle response, producing net propulsive work during level-ground walking and greater shock absorption during stair descent. The results of this study highlight the potential of prosthetic leg controllers that exploit neural signals to trigger terrain-appropriate, local prosthetic leg behaviors. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A variety of energy storage and return prosthetic feet are currently available for use within lower limb prostheses. Designs claim to provide a beneficial energy return during push-off, but the extent to which this occurs remains dis-puted. Techniques currently used to measure energy storage, dissipation and return within the structure of the prosthe-tic foot are debatable, with limited evidence to support substantial elastic energy storage and return from existing designs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of energy storage and return foot designs through con-sidering the ankle power during push-off and the effect on body centre of mass propulsion. To achieve this aim, the gait patterns of six trans-tibial prosthetic users wearing different designs of energy storage and return feet were analysed while ascending a ramp. Three examples of energy storage and return feet (suitable for moderate activity) were selected and randomly evaluated: the Blatchford's Epirus, ssur Assure and College Park Tribute feet. The power at the anatomi-cal and mechanical ankle joints was integrated to evaluate the work done over the gait cycle. The direction of the inertial force, and therefore propulsion of the body centre of mass, was used to indicate the effect of the energy return by the energy storage and return feet. Results indicate that although energy storage and return feet may provide energy return, the work done around the prosthetic ankle indicates net power absorption. Therefore, the prosthetic limb is unable to contribute to the body centre of mass propulsion to the same extent as the biological limb.},

abstract = {Habitual footwear use has been reported to influence foot structure with an acute exposure being shown to alter foot position and mechanics. The foot is highly specialised thus these changes in structure/position could influence functionality. This review aims to investigate the effect of footwear on gait, specifically focussing on studies that have assessed kinematics, kinetics and muscle activity between walking barefoot and in common footwear. In line with PRISMA and published guidelines, a literature search was completed across six databases comprising Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, AMED, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Fifteen of 466 articles met the predetermined inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All articles were assessed for methodological quality using a modified assessment tool based on the STROBE statement for reporting observational studies and the CASP appraisal tool. Walking barefoot enables increased forefoot spreading under load and habitual barefoot walkers have anatomically wider feet. Spatial-temporal differences including, reduced step/stride length and increased cadence, are observed when barefoot. Flatter foot placement, increased knee flexion and a reduced peak vertical ground reaction force at initial contact are also reported. Habitual barefoot walkers exhibit lower peak plantar pressures and pressure impulses, whereas peak plantar pressures are increased in the habitually shod wearer walking barefoot. Footwear particularly affects the kinematics and kinetics of gait acutely and chronically. Little research has been completed in older age populations (50+ years) and thus further research is required to better understand the effect of footwear on walking across the lifespan.},

This paper describes the first application of this methodology in the creation and experimental analysis of 3D printed cellular structures, which are capable of undergoing repeated compressions to densification without failure. A parametric study has been undertaken, capturing the energy absorbing capability of hexagonal arrays manufactured from two types of TPU, with relative densities 0.18–0.49. Arrays were subject to compressions at strain rates 0.03–0.3s−1 and were capable of absorbing energies over the range of 0.01–0.34J/cm3, before recovering elastically. Critically, samples attained a maximum energy absorbing ‘efficiency' of 0.36, which is comparable to that of traditional expanded closed cell polyurethane foams. The energy absorption behaviour of all structures was found to be dependent on strain rate and cell orientation with respect to the compression direction. This study shows the clear potential of FFF 3D printing for the creation of a new breed of cellular architectures, which are not constrained by existing manufacturing principles, offering the designer the capability to create resilient architectures specifically tailored to operational applications and environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Until recently, most manufacturing processes have been ‘subtractive' in that matter is removed (e.g., scraped, dissolved, turned, machined) from a substance in order to produce the desired product. 3-D printing turns traditional manufacturing on its head in that it uses an ‘additive' process. Similar to laser and inkjet printers, 3-D (three-dimensional) printers produce pieces by depositing, or adding, layers of material—plastic, polymer filaments, metals, and even foodstuffs—until the desired product is realized. This means that the creation and production of ‘one-offs' is not only easy, it is also economically viable. 3-D printers are becoming ever more affordable, and it is not hard to envision them being as common in most homes in the near future as their two-dimensional counterparts are today. This article presents a 3-D printing primer for non-technical managers. It then considers the profound impact that 3-D printing will have on firms of all kinds as well as on individual consumers. In addition, it raises the substantial questions that 3-D printing will pose to policy makers from both intellectual property and ethical standpoints.},

abstract = {Terrestrial legged locomotion requires repeated support forces to redirect the body's vertical velocity component from down to up. We assume that the redirection is accomplished by impulsive leg forces that cause small-angle glancing collisions of a point-mass model of the animal. We estimate the energetic costs of these collisions by assuming a metabolic cost proportional to positive muscle work involved in generating the impulses. The cost of bipedal running estimated from this collisional model becomes less than that of walking at a Froude number (v2/gl) of about 0.7. Two strategies to reduce locomotion costs associated with the motion redirection are: (1) having legs simulate purely elastic springs, as is observed in human running; and (2) sequencing the leg forces during the redirection phase; examples of this sequencing are the ba-da-dump pattern of a horse gallop and having push-off followed by heel-strike in human walking.},

abstract = {Historically, clinical applications of measurements of force and energy followed electromyography and kinematics in temporal sequence. This sequence is mirrored by the order of topics included in this trilogy on the Evolution of Clinical Gait Analysis, with part I [Sutherland DH. The evolution of clinical gait analysis part I: kinesiological EMG. Gait Posture 2001;14:61-70.] devoted to Kinesiological EMG and part II [Sutherland DH. The evolution of clinical gait analysis part II - kinematics. Gait Posture 2002;16(2):159-179.] to Kinematics. This final review in the series will focus on kinetics as it relates to gait applications. Kinematic measurements give the movements of the body segments, which can be compared with normal controls to identify pathological gait patterns, but they do not deal with the forces controlling the movements. As a major goal of scientifically minded clinicians is to understand the biomechanical forces producing movements, the objective measurement of ground reaction forces is essential. The force plate (platform) is now an indispensable tool in a state-of-the-art motion analysis laboratory. Nonetheless, it is not a stand-alone instrument as both kinematic and EMG measurements are needed for maximum clinical implementation and interpretation of force plate measurements. The subject of energy assessment is also given mention, as there is a compelling interest in whether walking has been made easier with intervention. The goals of this manuscript are to provide a historical background, recognize some of the important contributors, and describe the current multiple uses of the force plate in gait analysis. The widespread use of force plates for postural analyses is an important and more recent application of this technology, but this review will be restricted to measurements of gait rather than balance activities. Finally, this manuscript presents my personal perspective and discusses the developments and contributors that have shaped my thoughts and actions, and which I have found to be particularly noteworthy or intriguing. Just as in parts I and II, emphasis has been placed on the early development. All subtopics and important contributors, in this third and certainly most challenging of the review papers, have not been included. Some may find that my perceptions are incomplete. I accept responsibility for all deficiencies, as none were intended. Letters to selected contributors and their responses reveal how each contributor built on the work of others. The level of cooperation and sharing by these early investigators is extraordinary. Had they wished to withhold information about their own work, clinical gait analysis would have been severely delayed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a powered ankle-foot prosthesis improves gait mechanics, physical performance, and user satisfaction after traumatic transtibial amputation.

DESIGN: Pre-post.

SETTING: Gait analysis laboratory.

PARTICIPANTS: Young individuals with traumatic transtibial amputation (n=11) and matched controls (n=11).

INTERVENTIONS: Wearing an energy-storing and -returning (ESR) foot and a powered ankle-foot prosthesis.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gait mechanics, physical performance, and user satisfaction.

RESULTS: The powered prosthesis ankle range of motion (ROM) was significantly larger (∼30{\%}) than that of the ESR limb. However, both devices demonstrated significantly less ankle ROM than the control and intact limbs. At preswing, the ESR limb generated approximately 40{\%} less peak ankle power than control and intact limbs. In contrast, the powered prosthesis generated significantly greater peak ankle power than control (35{\%}) and ESR (∼125{\%}) limbs, resulting in the powered limb absorbing twice the peak knee power observed in the control and intact limbs. The powered prosthesis limb peak hip power generation was approximately 45{\%} greater at preswing than that of the intact limb. Walking velocity increased with the powered prosthesis compared with the ESR limb and was greater than that of the control group. However, physical performance measures were not significantly different between ESR and powered conditions. User satisfaction scores indicated a preference for the powered prosthesis over the ESR limb.

CONCLUSIONS: Compensatory strategies during gait with the ESR and powered prosthetic devices were similar to those reported in the literature. However, the addition of ankle power and ROM by the powered prosthesis appeared to increase compensatory strategies at proximal joints.},

The main classes are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses.

It explains how to model a rigid-body system and how to analyze it, and it presents the most comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms to be found in a single source. The use of spatial vector notation greatly reduces the volume of algebra which allows systems to be described using fewer equations and fewer quantities. It also allows problems to be solved in fewer steps, and solutions to be expressed more succinctly. In addition algorithms are explained simply and clearly, and are expressed in a compact form. The use of spatial vector notation facilitates the implementation of dynamics algorithms on a computer: shorter, simpler code that is easier to write, understand and debug, with no loss of efficiency. Unique features include: A comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms Use of spatial (6D) vectors to greatly reduce the volume of algebra, to simplify the treatment of the subject, and to simplify the computer code that implements the algorithms Algorithms expressed both mathematically and in pseudocode for easy translation into computer programs Source code for many algorithms available on the internet Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms is aimed at readers who already have some elementary knowledge of rigid-body dynamics, and are interested in calculating the dynamics of a rigid-body system.

abstract = {The purpose of this technical note is to introduce the effective foot length ratio (EFLR) as a possible measurement tool for evaluation of prosthetic feet. The EFLR multiplied by 100 provides the percentage of a foot that is effectively used during a walking step and may have clinical implications for step length and limb loading on the contralateral side. Prosthetic feet were manually rolled over a force platform while maintaining a constant level of force representative of a user's weight. Effective foot lengths were measured by finding the distance from the heel of each prosthetic foot to the center of pressure in foot-based coordinates at a loading angle that represented the approximate shank angle at opposite heel contact during walking. The effective foot lengths were then normalized by overall foot length to determine the EFLR. EFLRs from 15 prosthetic feet used clinically during the 1990s are presented along with an estimate of the EFLR of the physiologic ankle-foot system. All prosthetic feet had EFLRs lower than the corresponding physiologic system, although some had ratios close to the physiologic system. The EFLRs for the prosthetic feet were between 0.63 and 0.81, whereas the EFLR estimated for the physiologic system was 0.83.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify changes in muscle activity in below-knee amputees in response to increasing steady-state walking speeds. Bilateral electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from 14 amputee and 10 non-amputee subjects during four overground walking speeds from eight intact leg and five residual leg muscles. Using integrated EMG measures, we tested three hypotheses for each muscle: (1) there would be no difference in muscle activity between the residual and intact legs, (2) there would be no difference in muscle activity between the intact leg and non-amputee legs, and (3) muscle activity in the residual and intact legs would increase with speed. Most amputee EMG patterns were similar between legs and increased in magnitude with speed. Differences occurred in the residual leg biceps femoris long head, vastus lateralis and rectus femoris, which increased in magnitude during braking compared to the intact leg. These adaptations were consistent with the need for additional body support and forward propulsion in the absence of the plantar flexors. With the exception of the intact leg gluteus medius, all intact leg muscles exhibited similar EMG patterns compared to the control leg. Finally, the residual, intact and control leg EMG all had a significant speed effect that increased with speed with the exception of the gluteus medius.},

abstract = {Predictive simulation is a powerful approach for analyzing human locomotion. Unlike techniques that track experimental data, predictive simulations synthesize gaits by minimizing a high-level objective such as metabolic energy expenditure while satisfying task requirements like achieving a target velocity. The fidelity of predictive gait simulations has only been systematically evaluated for locomotion data on flat ground. In this study, we construct a predictive simulation framework based on energy minimization and use it to generate normal walking, along with walking with a range of carried loads and up a range of inclines. The simulation is muscle-driven and includes controllers based on muscle force and stretch reflexes and contact state of the legs. We demonstrate how human-like locomotor strategies emerge from adapting the model to a range of environmental changes. Our simulation dynamics not only show good agreement with experimental data for normal walking on flat ground (92{\%} of joint angle trajectories and 78{\%} of joint torque trajectories lie within 1 standard deviation of experimental data), but also reproduce many of the salient changes in joint angles, joint moments, muscle coordination, and metabolic energy expenditure observed in experimental studies of loaded and inclined walking.},

abstract = {In recent years, various heuristic optimization methods have been developed. Many of these methods are inspired by swarm behaviors in nature. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions is introduced. In the proposed algorithm, the searcher agents are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The proposed method has been compared with some well-known heuristic search methods. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Low back pain (LBP) is a major secondary disabling condition following lower limb amputation including persons with above-knee and below-knee amputation. Whilst the increasing prevalence of this musculoskeletal problem in people with lower limb amputation is well recognised, the mechanisms of LBP in this population have been poorly explored. Asymmetrical movements and loading patterns have been found in persons following lower limb amputation and linked to the high prevalence of LBP in this population. However, some argue that such asymmetries are part of the 'normal' adaptive process following lower limb amputation. We hypothesise that there is potential for some of the kinematic and kinetic adaptations in the lumbopelvic and trunk region to be 'mal-adaptive', potentially acting as a contributing factor for the onset or maintenance of LBP symptoms in this population. Evidence for movement and muscle asymmetries around the lumbopelvic and lower limb region provides some support for an association between LBP and movement asymmetry in the general population. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesise that movement asymmetries will demonstrate an association with LBP in lower limb amputee populations. Previous studies investigating movement and loading patterns within this population have focused mainly on gait analysis. Therefore, there is a need for further research to investigate the presence and potential association of asymmetrical movement patterns of the lumbopelvic region with LBP in a range of specific functional tasks. Results of such studies will identify the asymmetrical movement patterns and functional tasks associated with LBP in this population. Furthermore, it will inform future case-control and longitudinal studies to specifically investigate the putative links for such asymmetrical movement patterns as risk factors to LBP in this population. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Below-knee amputees commonly experience asymmetrical gait patterns and develop comorbidities in their intact and residual legs. Carbon fiber prosthetic feet have been developed to minimize these asymmetries by utilizing elastic energy storage and return to provide body support, forward propulsion and leg swing initiation. However, how prosthetic foot stiffness influences walking characteristics is not well-understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of foot stiffness on kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity, prosthetic energy storage and return, and mechanical efficiency during amputee walking. METHODS A comprehensive biomechanical analysis was performed on 12 unilateral below-knee amputees. Subjects walked overground at 1.2m/s with three prosthetic feet of varying keel and heel stiffness levels, which were created using additive manufacturing. FINDINGS As stiffness decreased, peak residual and intact leg ankle angles and residual leg knee flexion angle increased. The residual and intact leg braking ground reaction forces and knee extensor moments, residual leg vastus and gluteus medius activity, and intact leg vastus and rectus femoris activity also increased. The second vertical ground reaction force peak and hamstring activity in the residual leg and first vertical ground reaction force peak in the intact leg decreased. In addition, prosthetic energy storage and return increased and mechanical efficiency decreased as stiffness decreased. INTERPRETATION Decreasing foot stiffness can increase prosthesis range of motion, mid-stance energy storage and late-stance energy return, but the net contributions to forward propulsion and swing initiation may be limited as additional muscle activity to provide body support becomes necessary.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine physiological energy cost with Blatchford's 'Intelligent Prosthesis' (IP) compared to energy cost with a conventional pnuematic swing phase control (PSPC) mechanism. Design: Before-After trial: subjects fitted with IP walked on programmable treadmill at speeds: 6min slow, 6min fast, 8min while speed changed, between slow, normal, and fast, every minute, and 6min normal. Breath-by-breath analysis of subject's expired air determined average VO2 (L/min) within each period. Procedure repeated after 1-week interval using PSPC prosthesis. Testing sessions supervised by experienced prosthetist. Setting: Rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Volunteer sample. Three men, unilateral transfemoral traumatic amputee patients, ages 39 to 59 years. Normally used ischial containment socket, Blatchford Endolite Stabilised Stance Flex knee with PSPC and Multiflex foot and ankle. Interventions: Fitting, programming, and alignment of IP (own socket) by Bioengineering Unit's resident prosthetist. IP's microprocessor programmed to facilitate five walking speeds. Main Outcome Measure: Physiological energy cost (VO2), of using IP compared to using PSPC mechanism. Results: Two subjects displayed reduced VO2 of between 5.6{\%} and 9.0{\%} using IP compared to PSPC prosthesis at a pace either faster or slower than their normal pace. Third subject showed no significant change in oxygen consumption despite IP trait being heavier. All subjects displayed reduced VO2 (averaging 4.1{\%}) using IP for period of variable speed walking. Conclusions: Although differences were small, they tend to indicate that use of the heavier IP unit lowered the energy cost of walking at speeds other than the amputee's normal pace.},

abstract = {Computational modeling and simulation of neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) systems enables researchers and clinicians to study the complex muscle and joint dynamics underlying human movement. NMS models use equations, derived from physical and biological laws, to bridge the gap between the real and the abstract and help solve challenging real-world problems, from designing prosthetics to maximizing running speed to designing exoskeletal devices to enable walking after a stroke. NMS modeling and simulation has proliferated in the biomechanics research community over the past 25 years, but the lack of verification and validation standards remains a major barrier to wider adoption and impact. The goal of this paper is to establish practical guidelines for verification and validation of NMS models and simulations that researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and others can adopt to evaluate the accuracy and credibility of modeling studies. In particular, we review a general process for verification and validation applied to NMS models and simulations, including careful formulation of a research question and methods, traditional verification and validation steps, and documentation and sharing of results for use and testing by other researchers. Modeling the NMS system and simulating its motion involves methods to represent neural control, musculoskeletal geometry, muscle-tendon dynamics, contact forces, and multibody dynamics. For each of these components, we review modeling choices and software verification guidelines; discuss variability, errors, uncertainty, and sensitivity relationships; and provide recommendations for verification and validation by comparing to experimental data and testing robustness. We present a series of case studies to illustrate key principles. In closing, we discuss the challenges for the community to ensure the continued successful translation of modeling and simulation to analyze and solve the broad spectrum of problems necessary to improve human mobility.},

abstract = {In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths (0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length (from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

abstract = {Tools have been used for millions of years to augment the capabilities of the human body, allowing us to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Powered exoskeletons and other assistive devices are sophisticated modern tools that have restored bipedal locomotion in individuals with paraplegia and have endowed unimpaired individuals with superhuman strength. Despite these successes, designing assistive devices that reduce energy consumption during running remains a substantial challenge, in part because these devices disrupt the dynamics of a complex, finely tuned biological system. Furthermore, designers have hitherto relied primarily on experiments, which cannot report muscle-level energy consumption and are fraught with practical challenges. In this study, we use OpenSim to generate muscle-driven simulations of 10 human subjects running at 2 and 5 m/s. We then add ideal, massless assistive devices to our simulations and examine the predicted changes in muscle recruitment patterns and metabolic power consumption. Our simulations suggest that an assistive device should not necessarily apply the net joint moment generated by muscles during unassisted running, and an assistive device can reduce the activity of muscles that do not cross the assisted joint. Our results corroborate and suggest biomechanical explanations for similar effects observed by experimentalists, and can be used to form hypotheses for future experimental studies. The models, simulations, and software used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and can provide insight into assistive device design that complements experimental approaches.},

abstract = {This study describes the changes in hip and pelvic kinematics in 19 trans-femoral amputees, who were treated with an osseointegrated trans-femoral prosthesis. Patients were studied with 3-dimensional gait analysis, walking with socket prosthesis within two days before the osseointergration procedure. The post-operative gait analysis was carried out at the 2 year follow-up visit. Fifty-seven; age-, side- and gender-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Post-operative data showed that patients who had an osseointegrated transfemoral prosthesis increased their hip extension by 7.3° (p=0.007), changing from -2.6° (range -13.4° to 10.7°) to -9.9° (range -29.4° to 5°). Moreover, the pre-operative anterior pelvic tilt was reduced by 4.0° (p=0.016), changing from 21.7° (range 11.9-34.8°) to 17.7° (range 5.5-25.7°). Values for hip extension and pelvic tilt changed toward those of controls. These results confirm that patients treated with osseointegrated trans-femoral prosthesis encounter significant changes of their kinematic pattern in terms of hip extension and anterior pelvic tilt. Even though the changes were moderate they may, in the long-term have a positive influence on low-back biomechanics and could contribute to reducing the risk of further problems with low back pain.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Home 3D printing technology is rapidly evolving from a means of creating low-fidelity trinkets, to becoming a robust and viable method of batch production. This paper explores the potential that this technology has on the manufacture of prosthetic feet for children from developing countries – specifically referring to the variance in sizes as the child grows. An exploration of the design process undertaken in an industrial design honours year demonstrates how a low-cost (approx. AUD{\$}15.00 at wholesale material prices), 3D-printed prosthetic foot has a comparable, if not better, performance level than a SACH foot – the type of foot typically donated to provide aid to those from developing countries who would otherwise be unserved. Prototyping was undertaken using a hobby-level printer (the Makerbot Replicator 2) and Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament. This method of prototyping allowed the designer to undertake rapid iterations of the prototype to undergo basic testing using autoethnographic methods. The prosthesis' ability to be modified and produced on-site, on- demand could potentially redefine the opportunities available to prosthetists for accommodating varying gait patterns when providing low-cost aid to developing countries.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Performing simulated experiments on a virtual human or computer model is one of the most powerful methods to elucidate relationships between physiological structure and biomechanical performance. Surgical outcomes prediction, response to mechanical or therapy interventions, factors producing injury, theories of motor control and improved design of equipment are some areas that have been studied through simulation. Questions can be studied that may be difficult or even impossible, costly, and/or unethical to answer through human subject testing. The simulation framework lends itself to predicting the effect of neural, muscular, or skeletal alterations on performance. Biology, physics, and engineering relations are used to create the model or mathematical representation of the body. Because a variety of strategies can produce a single movement, similarity of model performance to reality does not ensure consistency between mathematical and natural control schemes. Assessing this consistency is a major obstacle to obtaining maximum benefit from simulation. Biomechanical simulation is a developing field; much effort goes into developing, controlling, and validating models. However, inroads to using models to answer questions relevant to rehabilitation are being made. An overview of the role of simulation, description of model development, and examples of some modeling and simulation applications in gait analysis are provided in this chapter. As the field matures, efficient control techniques, supercomputing resources, and accurate subject specific data from advanced imaging techniques are a few areas that can significantly enhance the practical utility of simulation as a clinical tool.},

abstract = {Machines and humans become mechanically coupled when lower limb amputees walk with powered prostheses, but these two control systems differ in adaptability. We know little about how they interact when faced with real-world physical demands (e.g. carrying loads). Here, we investigated how each system (i.e. amputee and powered prosthesis) responds to changes in the prosthesis mechanics and gravitational load. Five transfemoral amputees walked with and without load (i.e. weighted backpack) and a powered knee prosthesis with two pre-programmed controller settings (i.e. for load and no load). We recorded subjects' kinematics, kinetics, and perceived exertion. Compared to the no load setting, the load setting reduced subjects' perceived exertion and intact-limb stance time when they carried load. When subjects did not carry load, their perceived exertion and gait performance did not significantly change with controller settings. Our results suggest transfemoral amputees could benefit from load-adaptive powered knee controllers, and controller adjustments affect amputees more when they walk with (versus without) load. Further understanding of the interaction between powered prostheses, amputee users, and various environments may allow researchers to expand the utility of prostheses beyond simple environments (e.g. firm level ground without load) that represent only a subset of real-world environments.},

abstract = {Man and nature both exploit the remarkable properties of cellular solids, by which we mean foams, meshes and microlattices. To the non-scientist, their image is that of soft, compliant, things: cushions, packaging and padding. To the food scientist they are familiar as bread, cake and desserts of the best kind: meringue, mousse and sponge. To those who study nature they are the structural materials of their subject: wood, coral, cancellous bone. And to the engineer they are of vast importance in building lightweight structures, for energy management, for thermal insulation, filtration and much more. When a solid is converted into a material with a foam-like structure, the single-valued properties of the solid are extended. By properties we mean stiffness, strength, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, electrical resistivity and so forth. And the extension is vast-the properties can be changed by a factor of 1000 or more. Perhaps the most important concept in analysing the mechanical behaviour is that of the distinction between a stretch- and a bending-dominated structure. The first is exceptionally stiff and strong for a given mass; the second is compliant and, although not strong, it absorbs energy well when compressed. This paper summarizes a little of the way in which the mechanical properties of cellular solids are analysed and illustrates the range of properties offered by alternative configurations.},

abstract = {Compliant tendons act as energy stores, which benefit the energetics and power output of a muscle-tendon unit. However the compliance of tendon and the material properties may vary between individuals and hence alter the energy storing capacity of the tendon. We aimed to determine the in vivo Achilles tendon (AT) stress and strain during one-legged hopping and hence the contribution of elastic recoil to mechanical energy changes. We simultaneously measured the length of the Achilles tendon from the muscle-tendon junction to the insertion on the calcaneous and the approximate AT force in ten male participants. The position of the muscle-tendon junction was determined using ultrasound images that were projected into three-dimensional space. Achilles tendon force was measured using inverse dynamics. The results demonstrated that one-legged hopping elicited high tendon strains and that the force-length relationship of the whole tendon is relatively linear, particularly at high strains. The stiffness, elastic modulus and hysteresis varied across the population (inter-quartile range of 145-231 N mm-1, 0.67-1.07 GPa and 17-35{\%}, respectively). These values are within the reported biological range. An average of 38 J of energy was recovered from the elastic recoil of the tendon, which contributes 16{\%} of the total average mechanical work of the hop (254 J). The high strains measured here (average peak strain was 8.3{\%}) and in other studies may be possible due to the complex architecture of the Achilles tendon; however, prolonged hopping may well cause tendon damage. In conclusion, the properties of the elastic Achilles tendon can contribute significantly to the total mechanical work of the body during one-legged hopping; however, individual variation in the properties of the tendon vary the energy storing capacity of this structure.},

abstract = {Workers exposed to knee straining postures, such as kneeling and squatting, may present modifications in knee gait kinematics that can make them vulnerable to osteoarthritis. In this study, knee kinematics of workers exposed to occupational knee straining postures (KS workers) were compared to those of non-knee straining (non-KS) workers. Eighteen KS workers and 20 non-KS workers participated in the study. Three-dimensional gait kinematic data were recorded at the knee using an electromagnetic motion tracking system. The following parameters were extracted from flexion/extension, adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation angle data and used for group comparisons: knee angle at initial foot contact, peak angles, minimal angles and angle range during the entire gait cycle. Group comparisons were performed with Student t-tests. In the sagittal plane, KS workers had a greater knee flexion angle at initial foot contact, a lower peak knee flexion angle during the swing phase and a lower angle range than non-KS workers (p {\textless} 0.05). In the frontal plane, all parameters indicated that KS workers had their knees more adducted than non-KS workers. External/internal rotation range was greater for KS workers. This study provides new knowledge on work related to KS postures and knee kinematics. The results support the concept that KS workers might exhibit knee kinematics that are different from those of non-KS workers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The use of biomechanical simulations to understand the effects of ankle-foot orthoses in chil- dren with cerebral palsy could improve medical prescription by reducing costs and controlling the possibility of iatrogenesis and posture compensation. The aim of this study is to perform a biomechanical analysis of a patient with crouching gait and a volunteer with normal gait to develop an appropriate orthotic device for the patient. The analysis has been designed using a computerised simulation with the software OpenSim, where a generic musculoskeletal model was adapted to model two types of orthoses: fixed ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) and floor reaction ankle-foot orthosis (FRO). A residual reduction algorithm was applied to minimize the modelling effects as well as the marker data processing errors. Furthermore, a computer muscle control algorithm was used after addition of external forces to resolve the cinema- tic and kinematic parameters and obtain the end results. This study shows that the use of orthoses reduces the support time and favours step symmetry. AFO and FRO devices were compared taking into account parameters such as cinematic behaviour, articular moments and degrees of rigidity. For example, it was observed that the left lower limb worked better with the FRO simulation whereas the right limb achieved a good result with the FRO simulation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a computerised model could be used to assess the clinical conditions of the patient to design a personalised device and to anticipate and follow up the possible effects of the orthosis on a crouching gait.},

abstract = {The muscles and tendons of the lower extremity are generally considered the dominant producers of positive and negative work during gait. However, soft-tissue deformations not captured by joint rotations might also dissipate, store and even return substantial energy to the body. A key locomotion event is the collision of the leg with the ground, which deforms soft tissues appreciably in running. Significant deformation might also result from the impulsive ground collision in walking. In a study of normal human walking (N=10; 0.7-2.0 m s(-1) speeds), we show indirect evidence for both negative and positive work performed by soft tissue, consistent with a damped elastic collision and rebound. We used the difference between measured joint work and another quantity - the work performed on the body center of mass - to indicate possible work performed by soft tissue. At 1.25 m s(-1), we estimated that soft tissue performs approximately 7.5 J of negative work per collision. This constitutes approximately 60{\%} of the total negative collision work and 31{\%} of the total negative work per stride. The amount of soft tissue work during collision increases sharply with speed. Each collision is followed by 4 J of soft tissue rebound that is also not captured by joint work measures. Soft tissue deformation may save muscles the effort of actively dissipating energy, and soft tissue elastic rebound could save up to 14{\%} of the total positive work per stride. Soft tissues not only cushion impacts but also appear to perform substantial work.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents our new method, Short Segment-Structural Decomposition SubSpace (SS-SDSS), for the estimation of dynamic joint stiffness from short data segments. The main application is for data sets that are only piecewise stationary. Our approach is to: 1) derive a data-driven, mathematical model for dynamic stiffness for short data segments; 2) bin the non-stationary data into a number of short, stationary data segments; and 3) estimate the model parameters from subsets of segments with the same properties. This method extends our previous state-space work by recognizing that initial conditions have important effects for short data segments; consequently, initial conditions are incorporated into the stiffness model and estimated for each segment. A simulation study that faithfully replicated experimental conditions delineated the range of experimental conditions for which the method can successfully identify stiffness. An experimental study on the ankle of a healthy subject during a torque matching tasks demonstrated the successful estimation of dynamic stiffness in a slow, time-varying experiment. Together, the simulation and experimental studies demonstrate that the SS-SDSS method is a valuable tool to measure stiffness in functionally important tasks.},

abstract = {The generation of muscle-actuated simulations that accurately represent the movement of old adults requires a model that accounts for changes in muscle properties that occur with aging. An objective of this study was to adjust the parameters of Hill-type musculo-tendon models to reflect nominal age-related changes in muscle mechanics that have been reported in the literature. A second objective was to determine whether using the parametric adjustments resulted in simulated dynamic ankle torque behavior similar to that seen in healthy old adults. The primary parameter adjustment involved decreasing maximum isometric muscle forces to account for the loss of muscle mass and specific strength with age. A review of the literature suggested the need for other modest adjustments that account for prolonged muscular deactivation, a reduction in maximum contraction velocity, greater passive muscle stiffness and increased normalized force capacity during lengthening contractions. With age-related changes incorporated, a musculo-tendon model was used to simulate isometric and isokinetic contractions of ankle plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles. The model predicted that ankle plantarflexion power output during 120 deg/s shortening contractions would be over 40{\%} lower in old adults compared to healthy young adults. These power losses with age exceed the 30{\%} loss in isometric strength assumed in the model but are comparable to 39-44{\%} reductions in ankle power outputs measured in healthy old adults of approximately 70 years of age. Thus, accounting for age-related changes in muscle properties, other than decreased maximum isometric force, may be particularly important when simulating movements that require substantial power development.},

abstract = {3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, 1, zidovudine, RetrovirTM) is used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. AZT, after conversion to AZT-5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by cellular enzymes, inhibits HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). The major clinical limitations of AZT are due to clinical toxicities that include bone marrow suppression, hepatic abnormalities and myopathy, absolute dependence on host cell kinase-mediated activation which leads to low activity, limited brain uptake, a short half-life of about one hour in plasma that dictates frequent administration to maintain therapeutic drug levels, low potential for metabolic activation and/or high susceptibility to catabolism, and the rapid development of resistance by HIV-1. These limitations have prompted the development of strategies for designing prodrugs of AZT. A variety of 5'-O-substituted prodrugs of AZT constitute the subject of this review. The drug-design rationale on which these approaches are based is that the ester conjugate will be converted by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic cleavage to AZT or its 5{\&}prime;-monophosphate (AZT-MP). Most prodrug derivatives of AZT have been prepared by derivatization of AZT at its 5'-O position to provide two prominent classes of compounds that encompass: A) 5'-O-carboxylic esters derived from 1) cyclic 5'-O-carboxylic acids such as steroidal 17b-carboxylic acids, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, bicyclam carboxylic acid derivatives, O-acetylsalicylic acid, and carbohydrate derivatives, 2) amino acids, 3) 1, 4-dihydro-1-methyl-3-pyridinylcarboxylic acid, 4) aliphatic fatty acid analogs such as myristic acid containing a heteroatom, or without a heteroatom such as stearic acid, and 5) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs such as retinoic acid, and B) masked phosphates such as 1) phosphodiesters that include monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphate, carbohydrate, ether lipid, ester lipid, and foscarnet derivatives, 2) a variety of phosphotriesters that include dialkylphosphotriesters, diarylphosphotriesters, glycolate and lactate phosphotriesters, phosphotriester approaches using simultaneous enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of bis(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters, bis(S-acyl-2-thioethyl) (SATE) esters, cyclosaligenyl prodrugs, glycosyl phosphotriesters, and steroidal phosphotriesters, 3) phosphoramidate derivatives, 4) dinucleoside phosphate derivatives that possess a second anti-HIV moiety such as AZT-P-ddA, AZT-P-ddI, AZTP2AZT, AZTP2ACV), and 5) 5'-hydrogen phosphonate and 5'-methylene phosphonate derivatives of AZT. In these prodrugs, the conjugating moiety is linked to AZT via a 5'-O-ester or 5'-O-phosphate group. 5'-O-Substituted AZT prodrugs have been designed with the objectives of improving anti-HIV activity, enhancing blood-brain barrier penetration, modifying pharmacokinetic properties to increase plasma half-life and improving drug delivery with respect to site-specific targeting or drug localization. Bypassing the first phosphorylation step, regulating transport and conferring sustained release of AZT prolong its duration of action, decrease toxicity and improve patient acceptability. The properties of these prodrugs and their anti-HIV activities are now reviewed.},

abstract = {Elastic elements in prosthetic devices can help to reduce peak power (PP) and energy requirements (ER) for the actuators. Calculations showed that it is impossible with current commercial motor technology to mimic human ankle behavior in detail for higher walking and running speeds with single motor solutions using a Serial Elastic Actuator (SEA). Concerning this result we checked the requirements of a parallel elastic actuator (PEA) and a combination of serial and parallel (SE+PEA) springs. We found that a PEA can reduce PP additionally in comparison to the SEA by pre-loading the spring in the ﬂight phase. This reduces also peak torque. But this loading needs additional energy so that the ER increase in comparison to the SEA. The SE+PEA concept can further decrease PP. With that, the ER are less than the PEA but higher than for the SEA. The results show less beneﬁt for the PEA and the SE+PEA when a constant stiffness and a ﬁxed parallel spring slack length is used for both gaits and all speeds. All concepts show that mimicking human ankle joint behavior in running and walking at higher speeds is still challenging for single motor devices.},

abstract = {Numerous prosthetic feet are currently on the market for individuals with a transtibial amputation, each device aimed at raising the 3C-level (control, comfort and cosmetics) with slightly different characteristics. In general, prosthetic feet can be classified into three categories. These are, following the time line: conventional feet (CF), energy-storing-and-returning (ESR) feet and the recent so-called 'bionic' feet. Researchers have shown enhanced performance properties of ESR feet compared with early CF. However, even with the advanced technology, none of the ESR feet is capable of significantly reducing energy cost of walking or enhancing prosthetic gait (Nielsen et al. J Prosthet Orthotics 1989;1:24-31; Waters et al. J Bone Joint Surg Am 1976;58:42-46; Torburn et al. J Rehabil Res Dev 1990;27:369-384). From the 1990s, gradually more attention has been paid to the incorporation of active elements in prosthetic feet as the passive devices are not capable of providing the individual with sufficient ankle power during gait. Most part of the 'bionic' devices are still on the research level nowadays but one can expect that they will become available on the market soon. In this article, the evolution of prosthetic feet over the last two decades is reflected. The importance of mimicking human ankle-foot biomechanics with prosthetic feet is briefly discussed. Prior work in both objective and subjective evaluation of prosthetic gait is reported.},

abstract = {Millivolt level signals generated in residual muscles can be used to control sophisticated upper limb prosthetics. The low level voltages known as surface-electromyogram (sEMG) signals have seldom been applied in lower limbs due to moisture, large pressure, and shear forces which induced anomalies, and in particular triboelectric interference. An electronic module, known as a multi-sensor unit or MSU incorporates a multiplicity of sensors which promises to overcome the problems with sEMG in lower limbs. By incorporating a multiplicity of signals from what is physically happening in terms of pressure, temperature, and surface shear, it is anticipated that the sEMG signals can be corrected. Testing of the MSU with able bodied personnel and amputees is currently under way at Clarkson University. The MSU, which is totally potted is soft silicone rubber, measures sEMG, pressure, axial and tangential shear, and temperature. The 35 {\#}x00D7;65 {\#}x00D7;6.5mm electronic module is thin enough to be comfortably inserted between the liner of the prosthetic and the residual lower limb. As part of the program, a unique MEMS shear sensor, capable of being totally encased in silicone rubber, was developed. The temperature and pressure sensor are based on commercial off-the-shelf sensors. The design of the shear sensors is based on bonding a glass ball to a commercial off-the-shelf pressure sensor, thus avoiding the costly development of a custom shear sensor. The final MSU is both waterproof and rugged. Preliminary test results are briefly presented.},

abstract = {Lattice materials (LM) are a novel concept stemming from the combination of crystallo- graphy and structural optimisation algorithms. Their practical applications have become real with the advent of versatile additive layer manufacturing (ALM) techniques and the development of dedicated CAD/CAE tools. This work critically reviews one of the major claims concerning LMs, namely their excellent stiffness-to-weight performance. First, a brief literature review of spatially uniform LMs is presented, focusing on specific strength of stan- dard engineering materials as compared with novel structures. An original modelling and optimisation is carried out on a flat panel subject to combined shear and bending load. The calculated generalised specific stiffness is compared against reference values obtained for a uniform panel and the panel subjected to topological optimisation. Themonomaterial, a spa- tially repetitive solution turns out to be poorly suited for stiff, lightweight designs, because of suboptimal material distribution. Spatially non-uniform and locally size-optimised struc- tures perform better. However, its advantage over manufacturable, topologically-optimised conventional designs can at best be marginal ({\textless} 10{\%}). Cubic-cell lattices cannot replace conventional bulk materials in the typical engineering use. The multi-cell-type and multi- -material lattice structures, albeit beyond the scope of this article, are more promising from the point of view of mechanical properties. The possibility of approaching the linear scaling reported in the recent litterature can make them an attractive option in ultra-low weight designs.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Srinivas1994,
abstract = {In trying to solve multiobjective optimization problems, many traditional methods scalarize the objective vector into a single objective. In those cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands that the user have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. Since genetic algorithms (GAs) work with a population of points, it seems natural to use GAs in multiobjective optimization problems to capture a number of solutions simultaneously. Although a vector evaluated GA (VEGA) has been implemented by Schaffer and has been tried to solve a number of multiobjective problems, the algorithm seems to have bias toward some regions. In this paper, we investigate Goldberg's notion of nondominated sorting in GAs along with a niche and speciation method to find multiple Pareto-optimal points simultaneously. The proof-of-principle results obtained on three problems used by Schaffer and others suggest that the proposed method can be extended to higher dimensional and more difficult multiobjective problems. A number of suggestions for extension and application of the algorithm are also discussed.},

@article{Sun2015,
abstract = {This study is aimed to clarify the effect of entrapped gas on the dynamic crushing of 2D cellular structures in order to gain general insights into the associated mechanisms for cellular solids. An analytical method is proposed to determine the critical strain-rates for adiabatic and isothermal processes of the entrapped gas. The crushing processes at various strain-rates are simulated using finite element method with considering the effect of the entrapped gas pressure on the solid cell deformation. A higher-order strain term is introduced into the equations derived from the Gibson-Ashby approach to improve the analytical prediction at large deformation. The numerical results show that the gas effect is significant at the densification stage wherein the crushing stress can be remarkably enhanced. The stress enhancement can arise from not only the direct contribution of gas pressure but also its indirect effect on the cell deformation and cell-wall interaction, depending on the range of strain-rates. Moreover, the entrapped gas can reduce the densification strain, which is important at intermediate strain-rates; whereas other mechanical factors (e.g. inertia and shock) associated with the dynamic crushing generally increase the densification strain and their influence becomes dominant at high strain-rates. At the plateau stage, the crushing stress is hardly affected by the entrapped gas, although the gas pressure in locally crushed cells could be appreciably high and deformation bands with less compaction can be produced. The numerical results also show that the gas effect is dependent on cell morphology. The comparison between the numerical and analytical predictions indicates that great caution should be taken when the Gibson-Ashby approach is used to estimate the stress enhancement in dynamic crushing, and numerical models may be necessary to realise the complex effect of the entrapped gas on the compressive behaviour of cellular solids.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the functional and mental health status of severely injured traumatic amputees from the United Kingdom military at the completion of their rehabilitation pathway and to compare these data with the published normative data.

DESIGN: Retrospective independent group comparison of descriptive rehabilitation data recorded postrehabilitation.

SETTING: A military complex trauma rehabilitation center.

PARTICIPANTS: Amputees (N=65; mean age, 29±6 y) were evaluated at the completion of their rehabilitation pathway; of these, 54 were operationally (combat) injured (23 unilateral, 23 bilateral, 8 triple) and 11 nonoperationally injured (all unilateral).

INTERVENTIONS: Continuous ∼4-week inpatient, physician-led, interdisciplinary rehabilitation followed by ∼4-weeks of patient-led, home-based rehabilitation.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The New Injury Severity Score at the point of injury was used as the baseline reference. The 6-minute walk test, Amputee Mobility Predictor with Prosthesis, Special Interest Group in Amputee Medicine, Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre mobility and activity of daily living scores as well as depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7), mental health support, and pain scores were recorded at discharge and compared with the published normative data.

RESULTS: The mean New Injury Severity Score was 40±15. After 34±14 months of rehabilitation, amputees achieved a mean 6-minute walk distance of 489±117 m compared with age-matched normative distances of 459 to 738 m. The 2 unilateral groups walked (544 m) significantly further (P{\textgreater}.05) than did the bilateral amputee (445±104 m) and triple amputee (387±99 m) groups. All groups demonstrated mean functional mobility scores consistent with scores of either active adults or community ambulators with limb loss. In total, 85{\%} could walk/run independently and 95{\%} could walk and perform activities of daily living independently with an aid/adaptation. No significant difference in mental health outcome was reported between the groups (P{\textgreater}.05). At discharge, 98{\%} of patients were able to control their pain.

CONCLUSIONS: Severely injured military amputees who completed intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation achieved levels of physical function comparable with those in age-matched healthy adults. Mental health outcomes were indicative of preparedness for full integration back into society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot complications result in huge costs for both society and individual patients. Because our team performs numerous amputations each year for complicated diabetic foot ulcers, we conducted a study comparing the quality of life of diabetic amputees with a non-amputee group experiencing a diabetic foot ulcer. The aim of this study was to get better comprehension of the influence of amputation on physical and social aspects of our patients' quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study evaluated the influence of amputation for a diabetic foot ulcer on quality of life. We compared patients having experienced an amputation for a diabetic foot ulcer at least 1 year before the study, and outpatients experiencing regular visits for a current foot ulcer with no previous history of amputation. Quality of life was reported using the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 item health survey (MOS SF-36). RESULTS: Most of the chronic ulcers were neuroischemic (8/9). Except for the bodily pain, which was significantly higher in the ulcer group, no difference was found between the amputee and the ulceration-group, when considering the different items of the MOS-SF 36 scales. The ulceration-group had significantly more physical limitations and pain than the toe-or-transmetatarsal-amputation-group, whereas physical limitations were identical between the transtibial-amputation-group and the ulceration-group. Median scores were quite low in both groups, reflecting strong social and psychological consequences of diabetic foot ulcers. Global prognosis was bad with 56{\%} of the amputees having experienced another major cardiovascular event within 20 months after amputation. CONCLUSION: Better understanding of the consequences of diabetic foot complications is important for the general population and especially general practitioners. Psychological evaluation and support is important before and after amputation since it is a traumatic step for patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Humans normally dissipate significant energy during walking, largely at the transitions between steps. The ankle then acts to restore energy during push-off, which may be the reason that ankle impairment nearly always leads to poorer walking economy. The replacement of lost energy is necessary for steady gait, in which mechanical energy is constant on average, external dissipation is negligible, and no net work is performed over a stride. However, dissipation and replacement by muscles might not be necessary if energy were instead captured and reused by an assistive device. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a microprocessor-controlled artificial foot that captures some of the energy that is normally dissipated by the leg and "recycles" it as positive ankle work. In tests on subjects walking with an artificially-impaired ankle, a conventional prosthesis reduced ankle push-off work and increased net metabolic energy expenditure by 23{\%} compared to normal walking. Energy recycling restored ankle push-off to normal and reduced the net metabolic energy penalty to 14{\%}. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that reduced ankle push-off contributes to the increased metabolic energy expenditure accompanying ankle impairments, and demonstrate that energy recycling can be used to reduce such cost.},

abstract = {Direct attachment of an upper leg prosthesis to the skeletal system by a percutaneous implant is an alternative solution to the traditional socket fixation. In this study, we investigated long-term periprosthetic bone changes around two types of fixation implants using two different initial conditions, namely immediate post-amputation implantation and the conventional implantation after considerable time of socket prosthesis use. We questioned the difference in bone modeling response the implants provoked and if it could lead to premature bone fracture. Generic CT-based finite element models of an intact femoral bone and amputated bone implanted with models of two existing direct-fixation implants, the OPRA system (Integrum AB) and the ISP Endo/Exo prosthesis (ESKA Implants AG) were created for this study. Adaptive bone-remodeling simulations used the heel-strike and toe-off loads from a normal walking cycle. The bone loss caused by prolonged use of socket prosthesis had more severe effects on the ultimate bone quality than adaptation induced by the direct-fixation implants. Both implants showed considerable bone remodeling; the titanium screw implant (OPRA system) provoked more bone loss than the porous coated CoCrMo stem (ISP implant). The chance of the peri-prosthetic bone fracture remained higher for the post-socket case as compared to the direct amputation cases. In conclusion, both direct-fixation implants lead to considerable bone loss and bone loss is more severe after a prolonged period of post-socket use. Hence, from a biomechanical perspective it is better to limit the post-socket time and to re-design direct fixation devices to reduce bone loss and the probability of peri-prosthetic bone fractures.},

abstract = {Snap-fit joints are one of the cheapest and fastest connectors available. However, due to geometrical complexity of the joints and the limitations of injection molding, they are used almost exclusively in large-scale manufactured products. Additive manufacturing offers the possibility to create end-user products in small and medium numbers with almost unlimited design complexity. This clears the way for new solutions using snap-fit joints to be explored. In this contribution, the existing design guidelines for snap-fit joints are challenged with the design potentials of additive manufacturing. The general working principles of snap-fit joints prove to be simple, clear, and safe independent of the manufacturing process. While the principles remain unchanged, the advantages of additive manufacturing are utilized to improve the integration in the product and the user handling. By applying the design restrictions of the additive manufacturing processes Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) the existing guidelines are extended for new manufacturing processes. To demonstrate the new concepts and the capabilities of additive manufactured snap-fit joints a showcase is conceptualized, designed in detail and produced using Fused Deposition Modeling and Selective Laser Sintering. A lid of a container, similar to a jar, is designed as an integrated single component. Aspects of haptics and usability are integrated, resulting in a lid that can easily be assembled and disassembled using one hand only. The design features springs and snap-fit joints adapted to the advantages and limitations of additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {Moment-angle relationship (dynamic joint stiffness) - the relationship between changes in joint moment and changes in joint angle - is useful for demonstrating interaction of kinematics and kinetics during gait. However, the individual contributors of dynamic joint stiffness are not well studied and understood, which has thus far limited its clinical application. In this study, ankle dynamic joint stiffness was analyzed and decomposed into three components in thirty able-bodied children during the stance phase of the gait. To verify the accuracy of the decomposition, the sum of decomposed components was compared to stiffness computed from experimental data, and good to very good agreement was found. Component 1, the term associated with changes in ground reaction force moment, was the dominant contribution to ankle dynamic joint stiffness. Retrospective data from eight children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and idiopathic toe-walking was examined to explore the potential utility of analytical decomposition in pathological gait. Compared to controls, component 1 was the source of highest deviation in both pathological groups. Specifically, ankle dynamic joint stiffness differences can be further identified via two sub-components of component 1 which are based on magnitudes and rates of change of the ground reaction force and of its moment arm, and differences between the two patient groups and controls were most evident and interpretable here. Findings of the current study indicate that analytical decomposition can help identify the individual contributors to joint stiffness and clarify the sources of differences in patient groups. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Inverted pendulum models of walking predict that little muscle work is required for the exchange of body potential and kinetic energy in single-limb support. External power during walking (product of the measured ground reaction force and body center-of-mass (COM) velocity) is often analyzed to deduce net work output or mechanical energetic cost by muscles. Based on external power analyses and inverted pendulum theory, it has been suggested that a primary mechanical energetic cost may be associated with the mechanical work required to redirect the COM motion at the step-to-step transition. However, these models do not capture the multi-muscle, multi-segmental properties of walking, co-excitation of muscles to coordinate segmental energetic flow, and simultaneous production of positive and negative muscle work. In this study, a muscle-actuated forward dynamic simulation of walking was used to assess whether: (1). potential and kinetic energy of the body are exchanged with little muscle work; (2). external mechanical power can estimate the mechanical energetic cost for muscles; and (3.) the net work output and the mechanical energetic cost for muscles occurs mostly in double support. We found that the net work output by muscles cannot be estimated from external power and was the highest when the COM moved upward in early single-limb support even though kinetic and potential energy were exchanged, and muscle mechanical (and most likely metabolic) energetic cost is dominated not only by the need to redirect the COM in double support but also by the need to raise the COM in single support.},

The optimal topologies obtained from deterministic and robust topology optimization designs under tensor product grid and sparse grid with different levels are compared with one another to investigate the pros and cons of optimization algorithm on final topologies, and an extensive Monte Carlo simulation is also performed to verify the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Standard clinical gait analysis protocols usually limit to test self-selected speed gait: this approach is generally valid and permits time and cost saving. Yet, the literature evidences suggest that some pathologies (especially at onset or subclinical level) may not primarily affect plain gait, but more demanding locomotor tasks. In the present study we therefore propose a multiple-task gait analysis protocol including: self-selected, increased and decreased speed gait; walking on toes; walking on heels; step ascending and step descending, and apply it to 40 healthy subjects (20 aged 6-17, 20 aged 22-72) thus building extensive reference data set. Published studies already report normative data for some of these tasks, but inhomogeneously (due to different collecting methods and biomechanical models, population characteristics, nature of data). We verify a good correlation between our results and those presented by Schwartz et al. (2008) [12] in their study providing extensive data on the effect of walking speed on the gait of healthy children. In discussing the results, the rationale and effectiveness of each task is confirmed, and we supply an electronic addendum with comprehensive kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic normative data for the considered population, along with a set of reference parameters and related statistical analysis, as a premise for further applications on pathological subjects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Cellular materials have large use in many components acting as impact energy absorbers. These components have to be designed on the basis of the kind of impact, of the involved energy amount and of the maximum admissible load. The choice of the most suitable density for the selected type of foam is based on stress–strain behaviour, obtained by means of experimental tests and/or models. Only a few micro-mechanical models, as the Gibson model, take into account the density effects. These models could result quite complex to manage because of the need of, at least, a rough analysis of the actual foam structure. Conversely, most of the models used for numerical simulations are phenomenological models and have simple parameter identification based on fitting of experimental data, but they do not account for density effect. Experimental uniaxial compression tests performed for several types of foams, namely EPP, PUR (Bayfill EA), EPS and PPO/PS (Noryl GTX), at different density levels are used in order to identify, with an optimisation procedure devoted to the minimisation of the fitting residual evaluated by the least square method, the parameters of four cellular solid models. The considered models are four: the Gibson model [Gibson LJ, Ashby MF. Cellular solids. Structure and properties. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1997], the Rusch model [Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of flexible foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1969;13:2297–311; Rusch KC. Energy-absorbing characteristics of foamed polymers. J Appl Polym Sci 1969;14:1133–47; Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of brittle foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1970;14:1263–73], a modified version of the Gibson model and a new empirical model. The third and fourth models have been developed in order to better fit the experimental stress–strain curve. The obtained improvements in terms of weighted sum of the squared errors are shown. The experimental data are a good representation of the typical behaviour of these kinds of foams and can be useful for the validation of models and the comparison of their performance. Moreover the large basis of experimental data for different types of foams at different densities could be used for the analysis of the influence of the density on the model parameters. Explicit empirical formulations are proposed to express the dependency of the phenomenological model parameters on the foam density. These relationships permit the identification of whatever density foam derived from the same solid material and with the same micro-structure by means of a minimum set of experimental tests. At the same time the availability of a large quantity of experimental data is helpful to reach a higher level of confidence in the model parameter values. Finally the identified parameters vs. density laws for the considered types of foam could be used in order to assist the design of a given absorber and to find the optimum density for the specific application. Closed form expression for the specific energy W and the efficiency E can be obtained, based on the resulting identified phenomenological models.},

abstract = {Introduction: Amobile arm support (MAS) such as the passive systems JAECO WREX [1] or the ARMON device [2] can help persons with neuromuscular weakness to perform activities of daily living (ADL) autonomously. The presented work is part of the EU project MUNDUS (MUltimodal Neuroprosthesis for Daily Upper limb Support) and focuses on the design of a MAS that provides weight support for the patients arm and the possibility to block the essential degrees of freedom at defined positions. In clinical application this exoskeleton will be combined with Neuro Muscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to support patients with degenerative neuronal diseases or high level Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI). Patients/materials and methods: With a 3D-infrared-motioncature-system we determined the necessary range of motions (ROM) to perform ADL e.g. eating, or combing the hair. The weight supporting spring was calculated with Matlab taking several mechanical solutions into account. Focusing on simplicity and modularity the presented concept was designed in Catia V5 R19. Results: The preliminary investigation resulted in a design with two degrees of freedom (DoF) at the shoulder, one at the elbow joint and one for pro- and supination. Fig. 1 shows the digital mockup of the MAS mounted on a wheelchair. Due to the lightweight construction (3.4 kg) the MAS can also be worn with a body harness. Depending on the degree of motor deficiency and the effected muscle groups motors are foreseen to actuate the required DoF in addition to NMES. The weight compensating spring is integrated in the z-tube. Its pre-stressing can either be adjusted manually or by an electric motor. The compensation force of the spring is transmitted via a rope to the x-lever, on which the upper arm shell is mounted on a linear guide. The braking unit for the shoulder flexion and extension is realized as a strap brake mechanism. The bearings of the mechanical elbow joint are integrated into the electromagnetic brake. A pro- and supination module, which can be attached to the forearm rod, is also prepared to carry a hand module that can activate the fingers. Discussion and conclusion: The design concept offers a lightweight MAS with four lockable DoF. The modular concept is easy to adjust to different anthropological sizes and is both-sided. A prototype is being built to evaluate its functionality in a following study with patients at the rehabilitation centre.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{DeAsha2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: If a prosthetic foot creates resistance to forwards shank rotation as it deforms during loading, it will exert a braking effect on centre of mass progression. The present study determines whether the centre of mass braking effect exerted by an amputee's habitual rigid 'ankle' foot was reduced when they switched to using an 'Echelon' hydraulic ankle-foot device.

METHODS: Nineteen lower limb amputees (eight trans-femoral, eleven trans-tibial) walked overground using their habitual dynamic-response foot with rigid 'ankle' or 'Echelon' hydraulic ankle-foot device. Analysis determined changes in how the centre of mass was transferred onto and above the prosthetic-foot, freely chosen walking speed, and spatio-temporal parameters of gait.

FINDINGS: When using the hydraulic device both groups had a smoother/more rapid progression of the centre of pressure beneath the prosthetic hindfoot (p≤0.001), and a smaller reduction in centre of mass velocity during prosthetic-stance (p{\textless}0.001). As a result freely chosen walking speed was higher in both groups when using the device (p≤0.005). In both groups stance and swing times and cadence were unaffected by foot condition whereas step length tended (p{\textless}0.07) to increase bilaterally when using the hydraulic device. Effect size differences between foot types were comparable across groups.

INTERPRETATION: Use of a hydraulic ankle-foot device reduced the foot's braking effect for both amputee groups. Findings suggest that attenuation of the braking effect from the foot in early stance may be more important to prosthetic-foot function than its ability to return energy in late stance.},

The effective properties of multi-phase materials are obtained via homogenization technique which serves as a bridge of the finite element models of the macrostructure and the material microstructure. The base materials of periodic microstructures used in each phase of the macrostructure are divided into several groups and sensitivity analysis are carried out on them one by one. Meanwhile, the sensitivity number at the macrostructure is derived which is coupled with the designed material properties. Then, the composite configurations of material microstructures and macrostructures are inversely optimized concurrently based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) algorithm. Several 2D and 3D numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed design approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify which biomechanical and physiological parameters are the most relevant, commonly used, able to discriminate and/or have specific clinical relevance for the gait analysis of lower-limb amputees (LLA).

METHODS: We performed an electronic search via the PubMed, EMBASE and ISI Web of Knowledge databases from 1979 to May 2009. Two independent reviewers assessed the title and abstract of each identified study. The quality assessment of the full text was undertaken using a 13-item checklist divided into three levels: A, B, and C.

RESULTS: The literature search identified 584 abstracts to be considered. After applying the inclusion criteria, we reviewed the full text of a total of 89 articles. The mean article quality was 8±2. No A-level article was found; the primary reason was a negative score in blinded outcome assessment. Sixty-six articles (74{\%}) corresponded to a B-level, and two articles (2{\%}) corresponded to a C-level. Twenty-one articles (24{\%}) did not acquire enough points to be assigned to any level. In this study, we present and discuss the most commonly used and most relevant 32 parameters. Many of the parameters found were not reported in enough studies or in enough detail to allow a useful evaluation.

CONCLUSION: This systematic review can help researchers compare, choose and develop the most appropriate gait evaluation protocol for their field of study, based on the articles with best scores on the criteria list and the relevance of specific biomechanical and physiological parameters.},

To magnify the torque generated by an electric motor in the limited space of the compact device, a worm gear is utilized. However, the actual torque amplification ratio provided by the worm gear is different from the nominal speed reduction ratio due to friction, which makes the controller design challenging. In this paper, the friction effect is considered in the model of cRSEA, and a robust control algorithm is designed to precisely control the torque output in the presence of nonlinearities such as the friction.

abstract = {The coupling between joint kinematics and kinetics during level walking was analysed by plotting joint angles vs. joint moments about the hip, knee and ankle in nine normal male subjects walking at three different velocities. The curves obtained were reproducible, and variability among subjects was relatively low. Counterclockwise loops corresponded to energy produced, and clockwise loops to energy absorbed at the joint; both loops are described in different phases of the stride cycle. At increasing walking velocity some of the loops narrowed, thus revealing the possibility of energy recovery. Analysis of individual diagrams revealed that consistent portions of the moment-angle loops can be described as a sequence of quasi-constant slope phases, separated by transition periods where quasi-isometric changes in joint moment occur. This figure, which was particularly evident of the hip and ankle joints, is reminiscent of a mechanical system with elastic components. which, in different phases of the rhythmic locomotion activity, moves along discrete status levels characterized by specific length-tension relationships. Implications of the above results in terms of the neural control of joint properties during active movement are discussed.},

abstract = {Background Little evidence exists regarding how prosthesis design characteristics affect performance in tasks that challenge mediolateral balance such as turning. This study assesses the influence of prosthetic foot stiffness on amputee walking mechanics and balance control during a continuous turning task. Methods Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected from eight unilateral transtibial amputees as they walked overground at self-selected speed clockwise and counterclockwise around a 1-meter circle and along a straight line. Subjects performed the walking tasks wearing three different ankle-foot prostheses that spanned a range of sagittal- and coronal-plane stiffness levels. Findings A decrease in stiffness increased residual ankle dorsiflexion (10–13°), caused smaller adaptations ({\textless} 5°) in proximal joint angles, decreased residual and increased intact limb body support, increased residual limb propulsion and increased intact limb braking for all tasks. While changes in sagittal-plane joint work due to decreased stiffness were generally consistent across tasks, effects on coronal-plane hip work were task-dependent. When the residual limb was on the inside of the turn and during straight-line walking, coronal-plane hip work increased and coronal-plane peak-to-peak range of whole-body angular momentum decreased with decreased stiffness. Interpretation Changes in sagittal-plane kinematics and kinetics were similar to those previously observed in straight-line walking. Mediolateral balance improved with decreased stiffness, but adaptations in coronal-plane angles, work and ground reaction force impulses were less systematic than those in sagittal-plane measures. Effects of stiffness varied with the residual limb inside versus outside the turn, which suggests that actively adjusting stiffness to turn direction may be beneficial.},

The effective properties of the heterogeneous material are obtained through the homogenization theory, and these properties are integrated into the analysis of the macrostructure. The sensitivity analysis for the material unit cell is established for such a two-scale optimization problem. Then, a bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) approach is developed to achieve a clear and optimized topology for the material microstructure. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed optimization algorithm and a variety of anisotropic microstructures of cellular materials and composites are obtained.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Strains within the bone tissue play a major role in bone (re)modeling. These small strains can be assessed using experimental strain gage measurements, which are challenging and invasive. Further, the strain measurements are, in practise, limited to certain regions of superficial bones only, such as the anterior surface of the tibia. In this study, tibial strains occurring during walking were estimated using a numerical approach based on flexible multibody dynamics. In the introduced approach, a lower body musculoskeletal model was developed by employing motion capture data obtained from walking at a constant velocity. The motion capture data were used in inverse dynamics simulation to teach the muscles in the model to replicate the motion in forward dynamics simulation. The maximum and minimum tibial principal strains predicted by the model were 490 and -588 microstrain, respectively, which are in line with literature values from in vivo measurements. In conclusion, the non-invasive flexible multibody simulation approach may be used as a surrogate for experimental bone strain measurements and thus be of use in detailed strain estimations of bones in different applications.},

The predicted gait speeds were validated with actual values measured using a motion capturing system (VICON 460 system) through a five-fold cross-validation method, and the correlation coefficients (R) for the gait speed were 0.963 for normal walking, 0.978 for slow walking, and 0.950 for fast walking.

@article{Collins2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Humans normally dissipate significant energy during walking, largely at the transitions between steps. The ankle then acts to restore energy during push-off, which may be the reason that ankle impairment nearly always leads to poorer walking economy. The replacement of lost energy is necessary for steady gait, in which mechanical energy is constant on average, external dissipation is negligible, and no net work is performed over a stride. However, dissipation and replacement by muscles might not be necessary if energy were instead captured and reused by an assistive device. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a microprocessor-controlled artificial foot that captures some of the energy that is normally dissipated by the leg and "recycles" it as positive ankle work. In tests on subjects walking with an artificially-impaired ankle, a conventional prosthesis reduced ankle push-off work and increased net metabolic energy expenditure by 23{\%} compared to normal walking. Energy recycling restored ankle push-off to normal and reduced the net metabolic energy penalty to 14{\%}. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that reduced ankle push-off contributes to the increased metabolic energy expenditure accompanying ankle impairments, and demonstrate that energy recycling can be used to reduce such cost.},

abstract = {With particular interest on total hip arthroplasty (THA), optimization of orthopedic prostheses is employed in this work to minimize the probability of implant failure or maximize prosthesis reliability. This goal is often identified with the reduction of stress concentrations at the interface between bone and these devices. However, aseptic loosening of the implant is mainly influenced by bone resorption phenomena revealed in some regions of the femur when a prosthesis is introduced. As a consequence, bone resorption appears due to stress shielding, that is to say the decrease of the stress level in the implanted femur caused by the significant load carrying of the prosthesis due to its higher stiffness. A maximum stiffness topological optimization-based (TO) strategy is utilized for non-linear static finite element (FE) analyses of the femur-implant assembly, with the goal of reducing stress shielding in the femur and to furnish guidelines for re-designing hip prostheses. This is accomplished by employing an extreme accuracy for both the three- dimensional reconstruction of the femur geometry and the material properties maps assigned as explicit functions of the local densities.},

Problems arise when calculating the muscle-tendon work from increases in mechanical energy, largely in correctly attributing these increases either to energy transfer or to muscle-tendon work. In this study, the kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the centre of mass of the whole human body was measured (using a force platform) simultaneously with calculation of the kinetic and potential energy of the body segments due to their movements relative to the body centre of mass (using cinematography) at different speeds of walking and running. Upper and lower boundaries to the total work were determined by including or excluding possible energy transfers between the segments of each limb, between the limbs and between the centre of mass of the body and the limbs. It appears that the muscle-tendon work of locomotion is most accurately measured when energy transfers are only included between segments of the same limb, but not among the limbs or between the limbs and the centre of mass of the whole body.},

These theories are important, not just because they apply to practical problems of industrial interest, but because they form a solid theoretical base upon which mathematical techniques can be built, from which more complex theories can be constructed, to better mimic material behaviour. The emphasis is not on the voluminous current topical research, but on the necessary tools to understand viscoelasticity at a first year graduate level. The main aim is to provide a still compact book, sufficient at the level of first year graduate course for those who wish to understand viscoelasticity and to embark in modeling of viscoelastic multiphase fluids. To this end, a new chapter on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) was introduced which is relevant to model complex-structured fluids. All the basic ideas in DPD are reviewed, with some sample problems to illustrate the methodology.},

abstract = {Dynamic uniaxial impact behaviour of metal foams using a 3D cell-based finite element model is examined. At sufficiently high loading rates, these materials respond by forming 'shock or consolidation waves' (Tan et al., 2005a, 2005b). However, the existing dynamic experimental methods have limitations in fully informing this behaviour, particularly for solving boundary/initial value problems. Recently, the problem of the shock-like response of an open-cell foam has been examined by Barnes et al. (2014) using the Hugoniot-curve representations. The present study is somewhat complementary to that approach and additionally aims to provide insight into the 'rate sensitivity' mechanism applicable to cellular materials. To assist our understanding of the 'loading rate sensitivity' behaviour of cellular materials, a virtual 'test' method based on the direct impact technique is explored. Following a continuum representation of the response, the strain field calculation method is employed to determine the local strains ahead of and behind the resulting 'shock front'. The dynamic stress-strain states in the densification stage are found to be different from the quasi-static ones. It is evident that the constitutive behaviour of the cellular material is deformation-mode dependent. The nature of the 'rate sensitivity' revealed for cellular materials in this paper is different from the strain-rate sensitivity of dense metals. It is shown that the dynamic stress-strain states behind a shock front of the cellular material lie on a unique curve and each point on the curve corresponds to a particular 'impact velocity', referred as the velocity upstream of the shock in this study. The dynamic stress-strain curve is related to a layer-wise collapse mode, whilst the equivalent quasi-static curve is related to a random shear band collapse mode. The findings herein are aimed at improving the experimental test techniques used to characterise the rate-sensitivity behaviour of real cellular materials and providing data appropriate to solving dynamic loading problems in which cellular metals are utilised.},

abstract = {“Stiffness” is a term used to describe the force needed to achieve a certain deformation of a structure. In the biomechanical world, several different definitions of stiffness are used, but not all of them are explained adequately to those readers who are less familiar with biomechanical terminology. This paper gives examples for specific definitions which are based on the basic definition of stiffness of a loaded structure “Stiffness” = “Load” divided by “Deformation”, a definition which automatically includes that the “Deformation” is created by the “Load” addressed in the formula. There is an infinite number of possible configurations of “Load” (forces, moments, stresses, arbitrary groups of forces etc.) acting on a structure and there is also an infinite number of possible points in the structure, where the deformation (displacement, strain, angles, radii, curvature, etc.) can be measured. Therefore, the term “Stiffness” of a structure always requires an exact description of the load configuration and the exact localization and kind of deformation measured. Otherwise, the measured or calculated values cannot be compared with results from other authors. An external fixator reacts to different functional forces (axial force, bending moment, torque) with different deformations (axial displacement, several angles, strain etc.). Depending on the selection of the deformations, several stiffness values can be determined. A definition of stiffness as a constant property of a structure only makes sense for structures consisting entirely of linear elastic materials. This paper supports the understanding of different stiffness definitions in the literature and provides a simple rule for the control of the stiffness definition applied. «Steifigkeit{\aa}ist ein Begriff, der zur Beschreibung der notwendigen Kraft verwendet wird, um eine bestimmte Verformung einer Struktur zu erreichen. In der Biomechanik werden mehrere unterschiedliche Definitionen von Steifigkeit verwendet, aber nicht alle liefern angemessene Erkl{\"{a}}rungen f{\"{u}}r einen mit der biomechanischen Terminologie nicht allzu vertrauten Leser. Dieser Artikel stellt Beispiele f{\"{u}}r spezifische Definitionen vor, die sich auf die Basisdefinition der Steifigkeit einer belasteten Struktur gr{\"{u}}nden: «Steifigkeit{\aa}= «Last{\aa}geteilt durch «Verformung{\aa}. Diese Definition beinhaltet automatisch, dass die «Verformung{\aa}durch die in der Formel genannte «Last{\aa}verursacht wird. Es gibt unendlich viele Konfigurationsm{\"{o}}glichkeiten f{\"{u}}r eine auf eine Struktur einwirkende «Last{\aa}(Kr{\"{a}}fte, Momente, Spannungen, beliebige Kr{\"{a}}ftegruppen usw.), und es gibt ebenfalls unendlich viele Punkte an der Struktur, an denen die Verformung (Verschiebung, Dehnung, Winkel, Radien, Biegung usw.) gemessen werden kann. Daher erfordert der Terminus «Steifigkeit{\aa}einer Struktur immer eine exakte Beschreibung der Lastkonfiguration sowie die exakte Lokalisierung und Art der gemessenen Verformung. Sonst k{\"{o}}nnen die gemessenen oder errechneten Werte nicht mit den Ergebnissen anderer Autoren verglichen werden. Ein Fixateur externe reagiert auf unterschiedliche funktionelle Kr{\"{a}}fte (Axialkraft, Biegemoment, Drehmoment) mit unterschiedlichen Verformungen (axiale Verschiebung, verschiedene Winkel, Dehnung usw.). In Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeit von der Auswahl der Verformungen k{\"{o}}nnen v{\"{o}}llig verschiedene Steifigkeitswerte ermittelt werden. Eine Definition der Steifigkeit als konstante Eigenschaft einer Struktur ist nur f{\"{u}}r solche Strukturen sinnvoll, die ganz aus linear-elastischem Material bestehen. Dieser Artikel illustriert die Interpretation von verschiedenen speziellen Steifigkeitsdefinitionen in der Literatur und verwendet eine einfache Regel zur Kontrolle der angewendeten Steifigkeitsdefinition. La «raideur{\aa}correspond{\`{a}}la force n{\'{e}}cessaire{\`{a}}la d{\'{e}}formation d'une structure. Si, en biom{\'{e}}canique, plusieurs d{\'{e}}finitions sont utilis{\'{e}}es pour d{\'{e}}crire la raideur, toutes ne sont pas toujours clairement expliqu{\'{e}}es, surtout pour des lecteurs peu familiers des termes sp{\'{e}}cialis{\'{e}}s. Cet article pr{\'{e}}sente des exemples de d{\'{e}}finitions sp{\'{e}}cifiques issues de la d{\'{e}}finition de base de la raideur d'une structure mise en charge: «Raideur{\aa}= «Charge{\aa}/ «D{\'{e}}formation{\aa}, o{\`{u}}la «D{\'{e}}formation{\aa}est la cons{\'{e}}quence de la «Charge{\aa}. Il existe un nombre illimit{\'{e}}de configurations possibles de la «Charge{\aa}(forces, moments, tensions, groupes arbitraires de force, etc.) agissant sur une structure et{\'{e}}galement un nombre illimit{\'{e}}de points de la structure o{\`{u}}l'on peut mesurer la d{\'{e}}formation (d{\'{e}}placement, fatigue, angles, rayons, courbure, etc.). En cons{\'{e}}quence, appliqu{\'{e}}{\`{a}}une structure, le terme «Raideur{\aa}doit toujours correspondre{\`{a}}une description exacte de la configuration de charge et pr{\'{e}}ciser la localisation et le type de d{\'{e}}formation. Sans cette pr{\'{e}}cision, les valeurs mesur{\'{e}}es ou calcul{\'{e}}es par diff{\'{e}}rents auteurs ne sont pas comparables. Un fixateur externe r{\'{e}}agit aux diff{\'{e}}rentes forces fonctionnelles (force axiale, moment de flexion, moment de torsion) en imposant diff{\'{e}}rentes d{\'{e}}formations (d{\'{e}}placement axial, plusieurs angles, fatigue, etc). En fonction des d{\'{e}}formations choisies, on peut d{\'{e}}terminer plusieurs valeurs de raideur. En tant que propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}d'une structure, une d{\'{e}}finition de raideur n'a de sens que pour les structures enti{\`{e}}rement form{\'{e}}es de mat{\'{e}}riaux{\`{a}}{\'{e}}lasticit{\'{e}}lin{\'{e}}aire. Cet article est une aide{\`{a}}la compr{\'{e}}hension des diff{\'{e}}rentes d{\'{e}}finitions de raideur pr{\'{e}}sentes dans la litt{\'{e}}rature et propose une r{\`{e}}gle simple pour valider la d{\'{e}}finition de raideur utilis{\'{e}}e. El t{\'{e}}rmino «rigidez{\aa}se emplea para describir la fuerza necesaria para conseguir una determinada deformaci{\'{o}}n de una estructura. En el mundo biomec{\'{a}}nico se utilizan varias definiciones distintas de rigidez, pero no todas ellas se han explicado adecuadamente a los lectores menos familiarizados con la terminolog{\'{i}}a biomec{\'{a}}nica. En este trabajo se ofrece una serie de ejemplos para definiciones concretas que est{\'{a}}n basados en la definici{\'{o}}n b{\'{a}}sica de rigidez de una estructura bajo carga. «Rigidez{\aa}= «Carga{\aa}dividida por «Deformaci{\'{o}}n{\aa}, una definici{\'{o}}n de la que autom{\'{a}}ticamente se deduce que la «Deformaci{\'{o}}n{\aa}es creada por la «Carga” a la que hace referencia la f{\'{o}}rmula. Existe un n{\'{u}}mero infinito de posibles configuraciones de «Carga” (fuerzas, momentos, esfuerzos, grupos arbitrarios de fuerzas, etc.) que pueden actuar sobre una estructura y, adem{\'{a}}s, existe un n{\'{u}}mero infinito de posibles puntos de la estructura en los que la deformaci{\'{o}}n (desplazamiento, alargamiento,{\'{a}}ngulos, radios, curvatura, etc.) puede ser medida. Por lo tanto, el t{\'{e}}rmino «rigidez{\aa}de una estructura siempre requiere la descripci{\'{o}}n exacta de la configuraci{\'{o}}n de fuerzas y la exacta localizaci{\'{o}}n y tipo de la deformaci{\'{o}}n medida.

Un fijador externo frente a una serie de fuerzas funcionales distintas (fuerza axial, momento flector, momento de torsi{\'{o}}n) reacciona con diferentes tipos de deformaci{\'{o}}n (desplazamiento axial, distintos{\'{a}}ngulos, alargamiento, etc.). Dependiendo de la deformaci{\'{o}}n, pueden determinarse varios valores de rigidez. Dar una definici{\'{o}}n de rigidez como propiedad constante de una estructura s{\'{o}}lo tiene sentido en el caso de estructuras constituidas en su totalidad por materiales linealmente el{\'{a}}sticos. Este trabajo aporta datos para la comprensi{\'{o}}n de distintas definiciones de rigidez que existen en la literatura y ofrece una regla sencilla para controlar la definici{\'{o}}n de rigidez aplicada.},

abstract = {Lower-limb amputees commonly utilize non-articulating energy storage and return (ESAR) prostheses for high impact activities such as sprinting. Despite these prostheses lacking an articulating ankle joint, amputee gait analysis conventionally features a two-link segment model of the prosthetic foot. This paper investigated the effects of the selected link segment model׳s marker-set and geometry on a unilateral amputee sprinter׳s calculated lower-limb kinematics, kinetics and energetics. A total of five lower-limb models of the Ottobock{\textregistered}1E90 Sprinter were developed, including two conventional shank-foot models that each used a different version of the Plug-in-Gait (PiG) marker-set to test the effect of prosthesis ankle marker location. Two Hybrid prosthesis-specific models were then developed, also using the PiG marker-sets, with the anatomical shank and foot replaced by prosthesis-specific geometry separated into two segments. Finally, a Multi-link segment (MLS) model was developed, consisting of six segments for the prosthesis as defined by a custom marker-set. All full-body musculoskeletal models were tested using four trials of experimental marker trajectories within OpenSim 3.2 (Stanford, California, USA) to find the affected and unaffected hip, knee and ankle kinematics, kinetics and energetics. The geometry of the selected lower-limb prosthesis model was found to significantly affect all variables on the affected leg (p {\textless} 0.05), and the marker-set also significantly affected all variables on the affected leg, and none of the unaffected leg variables. The results indicate that the omission of prosthesis-specific spatial, inertial and elastic properties from full-body models significantly affects the calculated amputee gait characteristics, and we therefore recommend the implementation of a MLS model.},

abstract = {Robotic prostheses have the potential to significantly improve mobility for people with lower-limb amputation. Humans exhibit complex responses to mechanical interactions with these devices, however, and computational models are not yet able to predict such responses meaningfully. Experiments therefore play a critical role in development, but have been limited by the use of product-like prototypes, each requiring years of development and specialized for a narrow range of functions. Here we describe a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis system that enables rapid exploration of a wide range of dynamical behaviors in experiments with human subjects. This emulator comprises powerful off-board motor and control hardware, a flexible Bowden cable tether, and a lightweight instrumented prosthesis, resulting in a combination of low mass worn by the human (0.96 kg) and high mechatronic performance compared to prior platforms. Benchtop tests demonstrated closed-loop torque bandwidth of 17 Hz, peak torque of 175 Nm, and peak power of 1.0 kW. Tests with an anthropomorphic pendulum "leg" demonstrated low interference from the tether, less than 1 Nm about the hip. This combination of low worn mass, high bandwidth, high torque, and unrestricted movement makes the platform exceptionally versatile. To demonstrate suitability for human experiments, we performed preliminary tests in which a subject with unilateral transtibial amputation walked on a treadmill at 1.25 ms-1 while the prosthesis behaved in various ways. These tests revealed low torque tracking error (RMS error of 2.8 Nm) and the capacity to systematically vary work production or absorption across a broad range (from -5 to 21 J per step). These results support the use of robotic emulators during early stage assessment of proposed device functionalities and for scientific study of fundamental aspects of human-robot interaction. The design of simple, alternate end-effectors would enable studies at other joints or with additional degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {In walking the human body is never in balance. Most of the time the trunk is supported by one leg and the centre of mass (CoM) 'falls' to the contralateral side. In dynamical situations the velocity of the CoM should be acknowledged as well in the 'extrapolated centre of mass' (XcoM). Centre of pressure (CoP) position was recorded by a treadmill with built-in force transducers. Lateral CoM and XcoM position were computed by filtering the CoP data. Subjects were six above-knee amputees and six matched healthy controls. They walked at approximately 0.75, 1, and 1.25 m/s for 2 min. Amputees showed asymmetric gait with shorter stance (60{\%}) at the prosthetic side versus 68{\%} at the non-prosthetic side and a wider stride (13 ?? 4 cm, mean ?? S.D.) compared to controls (9 ?? 3 cm). At foot placement CoP was just lateral to the XcoM. The margin between average CoP and XcoM at foot contact was only 1.6 ?? 0.7 cm in controls, 2.7 ?? 0.5 cm in amputees at the prosthetic side and 1.9 ?? 0.6 cm at the non-prosthetic side. Next to this 'stepping strategy', CoP position was corrected after initial contact by modulating the lateral foot roll-off ('lateral ankle strategy') in non-prosthetic legs up to about 2 cm. A simple mechanical model, the inverted pendulum model, can explain that: (1) a less precise foot placement (greater CoP-XcoM margin) results in a wider stride, (2) this effect can be reduced by walking with a higher cadence, and (3) a greater margin at one side, as with a leg prosthesis, should be compensated by a shorter stance duration at the same side to achieve a straight path. This suggests that not in all cases symmetric gait should be an aim of rehabilitation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest in the use of muscle-actuated forward dynamic simulations to describe human locomotion. These models simulate movement through the integration of dynamic equations of motion and usually are driven by excitation inputs to muscles. Because motion is effected by individual muscle actuators, these simulations offer potential insights into the roles played by muscles in producing walking motions. Better knowledge of the actions of muscles should lead to clarification of the etiology of movement disorders and more effective treatments. This article reviews the use of such simulations to characterize musculoskeletal function and describe the actions of muscles during normal and pathological locomotion. The review concludes by identifying ways in which models must be improved if their potential for clinical utility is to be realized.},

abstract = {Control schemes for powered ankle-foot prostheses would benefit greatly from a means to make them inherently adaptive to different walking speeds. Towards this goal, one may attempt to emulate the intact human ankle, as it is capable of seamless adaptation. Human locomotion is governed by the interplay among legged dynamics, morphology and neural control including spinal reflexes. It has been suggested that reflexes contribute to the changes in ankle joint dynamics that correspond to walking at different speeds. Here, we use a data-driven muscle-tendon model that produces estimates of the activation, force, length and velocity of the major muscles spanning the ankle to derive local feedback loops that may be critical in the control of those muscles during walking. This purely reflexive approach ignores sources of non-reflexive neural drive and does not necessarily reflect the biological control scheme, yet can still closely reproduce the muscle dynamics estimated from biological data. The resulting neuromuscular model was applied to control a powered ankle-foot prosthesis and tested by an amputee walking at three speeds. The controller produced speed-adaptive behaviour; net ankle work increased with walking speed, highlighting the benefits of applying neuromuscular principles in the control of adaptive prosthetic limbs.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations play an important role in solving complex engineering problems and have the potential to revolutionize medical decision making and treatment strategies. In this paper, we combine the rapid model-based design, control systems and powerful numerical method strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with the simulation and human movement dynamics strengths of OpenSim by developing a new interface between the two software tools. OpenSim is integrated with Simulink using the MATLAB S-function mechanism, and the interface is demonstrated using both open-loop and closed-loop control systems. While the open-loop system uses MATLAB/Simulink to separately reproduce the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool, the closed-loop system adds the unique feature of feedback control to OpenSim, which is necessary for most human movement simulations. An arm model example was successfully used in both open-loop and closed-loop cases. For the open-loop case, the simulation reproduced results from the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool with root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.03° for the shoulder elevation angle and 0.06° for the elbow flexion angle. MATLAB's variable step-size integrator reduced the time required to generate the forward dynamic simulation from 7.1. s (OpenSim) to 2.9. s (MATLAB). For the closed-loop case, a proportional-integral-derivative controller was used to successfully balance a pole on model's hand despite random force disturbances on the pole. The new interface presented here not only integrates the OpenSim and MATLAB/Simulink software tools, but also will allow neuroscientists, physiologists, biomechanists, and physical therapists to adapt and generate new solutions as treatments for musculoskeletal conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the impact force during foot-ground impact activities such as the running. A previously developed model is used for this study. The model is a lumped-parameter one consisting of four masses connected to each other via linear springs and viscous dampers. A shoe-specific nonlinear function is used for representation of the ground reaction force. The authors have previously showed that the previous version of the model as well as its simulation is incorrect. This paper slightly modifies the previous model so as it is able to produce results in agreement with the experiments. Then, the modified model is simulated for two typical shoe types. A parametric study is also conducted. The parametric study concerns with the effects of masses, mass ratios, stiffness constants, and damping coefficients on the dynamics of the impact. It is shown that the impact forces increase as the rigid and wobbling masses increase. However, the increase in the impact forces is not the same for all the masses. It is found that the impact force increases as the touchdown velocities increase. Simulations imply that the variations of the damping coefficients result in larger variations of the impact force compared to the stiffness. The effect of the variation of gravity on the simulated impact force is also explored. It is concluded that both the first and the second peaks of the impact force are increased with gravity. An in-depth discussion is included to compare results of the current paper with results of other investigators.},

abstract = {Patients with an above-the-knee amputation often experience poor socket fit, which may become more problematic with minor weight changes, sweating, and skin problems. In 1999, the first author began using a transcutaneous, press-fit distal femoral intramedullary device with the distal, external portion serving as a hard point for attachment of an above-the-knee prosthesis (Fig. 1). The implant is placed in a retrograde fashion as a first stage, and approximately six to eight weeks later this is followed by stomatization, in which the distal aspect of the implant is exposed and an extension is added for fixation of the above-the-knee prosthesis. Thirty-seven patients underwent the procedure between 1999 and December 2009. The indications for surgery were persistent difficulties with the socket of an above-the-knee prosthesis after an above-the-knee amputation; the amputations had typically followed trauma but in some cases were for surgical treatment of a malignant tumor.

In 1999, ESKA Implants (Lubeck, Germany) produced the Endo-Exo-Femurprosthesis, which was first implanted into the femoral canal of a young man who had lost a leg in a motorcycle accident. Since then, the device has undergone design improvements, and by late 2009 it had been implanted in thirty-seven patients in Lubeck, Germany.

abstract = {An alternative to prosthetic socket rehabilitation of patients with transfemoral amputation is realized by means of direct skeletal fixation devices. offering significant improvements in mobility and comfort. However, strain shielding due to high stiffness of these metal-based implants causes considerable and progressive bone loss. To overcome this phenomenon a new concept of a direct fixation implant, in form of a collared metallic pin articulating inside a polymer intramedullary part, was developed. In this study we used experimental and finite element techniques to assess whether the novel concept produced a more physiological strain distribution in the bone as compared to a standard titanium implant. Cortical strains were measured experimentally on seven human cadaver femora, both intact and implanted with a generic standard implant and the new implant. Three load configurations were considered, simulating: heel strike, toe off and one leg stance. A finite element model derived from computed tomography data was used to calculate strains in intact bone and bone with generic models of the two implant types. Significant strain shielding occurred around both implant types, albeit that for the novel design strain shielding was generally less (p{\textless}0.04). Significant differences in strain shielding between both implant types were obtained for heel strike at the distal (p{\textless}0.04) and the middle level (p{\textless}0.03), as well as for the one leg stance at the middle level (p{\textless}0.03) showing 21-29{\%} less strain shielding for the new implant in these cases. Finite element results were in agreement with the experimental findings: more strain shielding for the standard implant as compared to the novel design. In fact, the benefit of the new design was bigger in the simulations as compared to the experimental measurements, which was attributed to the idealized collar-cortex fit in the FE model of the new design which was not obtained in the experiments. In conclusion, the study showed that the new implant has a potential to increase distal load transfer to the femur and reduce strain shielding as compared with the standard implant. Collar-cortex contact is an important aspect and requires further attention when developing the surgical technique. The encouraging results obtained in this study justify further development of this concept in order to improve the quality and applicability of direct skeletal fixation devices for patients requiring a transfemoral amputation.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lower limb amputation (LLA) is life-changing surgery. Shorter residual limbs are known to place greater physiological strain on patients than longer residual limbs; however, there is ongoing debate as to whether through-knee amputations are preferable to above-knee amputations. This analysis aims to resolve this question by systematically collecting and pooling published and unpublished data on this subject.

METHODS: An exhaustive search of Medline, Embase and Recal databases was made for outcome studies of patients with lower limb amputations following trauma. Studies concerned with amputations of the upper limb or foot and ankle were excluded as were papers reporting outcomes in a population of mixed trauma and non-trauma patients. Authors of studies published in the last 10 years were contacted for unpublished details. Patients were then divided, according to amputation height, into four groups: below-knee amputation (BKA), through-knee amputation (TKA), above-knee amputation (AKA) and bilateral amputation. The primary outcome measure was Physical Component Score (PCS) of the short-form-36 measure of quality of life and secondary outcomes were pain, employment, ability to walk 500m and proportion of time that prosthesis is worn.

RESULTS: As many as 27 studies were included, representing a total of 3105 patients, 1855 with a BKA, 104 with a TKA, 888 with an AKA and 258 bilateral amputees. There was progressive and significant lowering of PCS (worsening outcomes) as unilateral amputation height became more proximal from BKA to TKA and AKA. A significantly greater proportion of patients with a BKA or a TKA were able to walk 500m than those with an AKA or bilateral amputation (p=0.0035). However, patients with a TKA wore their prosthesis significantly less, and had significantly more pain than those with an AKA.

CONCLUSION: This study describes the impact of LLA of different levels on patients' lives. The results indicate that patients with a TKA have a better physical quality of life than those with an AKA and, therefore, support the surgical strategy of maintaining maximum length and performing TKA in preference to AKA, where possible.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.This review paper provides a synthetic yet critical overview of the key biomechanical principles of human bipedal walking and their current implementation in robotic platforms. We describe the functional role of human joints, addressing in particular the relevance of the compliant properties of the different degrees of freedom throughout the gait cycle. We focused on three basic functional units involved in locomotion, i.e. the ankle-foot complex, the knee, and the hip-pelvis complex, and their relevance to whole-body performance. We present an extensive review of the current implementations of these mechanisms into robotic platforms, discussing their potentialities and limitations from the functional and energetic perspectives. We specifically targeted humanoid robots, but also revised evidence from the field of lower-limb prosthetics, which presents innovative solutions still unexploited in the current humanoids. Finally, we identified the main critical aspects of the process of translating human principles into actual machines, providing a number of relevant challenges that should be addressed in future research.},

The results of changes in speed on gait parameters were examined using dimensionless analysis on data from a prospective 5-year study of 16 children. Linear regression analysis of peak and trough values of temporal distance parameters, ground reaction forces, joint angles, moments and powers provide a quantitative description of gait development with normalised speed. These linear relationships can be used to estimate gait parameters from speed measurements for normal subjects. However, caution is advised in using the data to attempt to predict an individual's gait parameters due to the wide spread of data about the regression lines and we do not recommend that the data be used to extrapolate the regression data to wider speed ranges. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This article presents results on the effectiveness of a new version of the titanium porous composite skin and bone integrated pylon (SBIP). The SBIP is designed for direct skeletal attachment of limb prostheses and was evaluated in a preclinical study with three rabbits. In accordance with the study protocol, a new version of the pylon (SBIP-3) was implanted into the hind leg residuum of three rabbits. The SBIP-3 has side fins that are designed to improve the bond between the bone and pylon. The fins are positioned inside two slots precut in the bone walls; their length can be adjusted to match the thickness of the bone walls. After 13 (animal 1) or 26 (animals 2 and 3) wk, the animals were sacrificed and samples collected for histopathological analysis. The space between the fins and the bone into which they were fit was filled with fibrovascular tissue and woven bone. No substantial inflammation was found. We suggest that if further studies substantiate the present results, the proposed method can become an alternative to the established technique of implanting prostheses into the medullary canal of the hosting bone.},

OpenSim provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through a multi-institutional collaboration.

abstract = {A second edition is always a cause for celebration. For the pub-lisher, it confirms his hope that the product he sponsored would con-tinue to be successful economically. For the author, the implications are even more delicious. His message has been understood, studied, and used. One could rarely ask for more from a professional thinker and a proponent ofbetter ways to think. To me the most striking mark of success is that the software indispensable to the tools and tech-niques which Godet describes, explains, and advocates has been down-loaded from the Internet over 7000 times, at no cost. While a number of futures works in the English speaking world are accompanied by software packages in the form of CDs, the Godet approach -make it free with the help of the Entrepreneurs of the Future Circle — is far more socially valuable. The second advantage I see in this new edition is pulling some of the good ideas out of chapter three to integrate into other chapters, and then creating an entirely new chapter three. He hunts down a par-ticularly subversive form of thinking, or more properly, failure to think, in the form of six clusters of cliches. Other minor changes throughout sharpen, clarify, or expand on details. If clarity is a virtue, Michel Godet is a saint. Two features of Pro-fessor Godet's career show through clearly in his new tour de force. First, as a university professor, he admires and practices clarity, con-sistency, and intellectual integrity. As a consultant practitioner -one of the most eminent in France -he brings to his treatment ofscenario planning as a strategic management tool, a degree ofpracticality and flexibility which is admirable. His attitude and precepts if adopted would greatly benefit all ofthose who could be successful in the use of scenarios as a planning tool and in strategic management.},

abstract = {Lower-limb amputees expend more energy to walk than non-amputees and have an elevated risk of secondary disabilities. Insufficient push-off by the prosthetic foot may be a contributing factor. We aimed to systematically study the effect of prosthetic foot mechanics on gait, to gain insight into fundamental prosthetic design principles. We varied a single parameter in isolation, the energy-storing spring in a prototype prosthetic foot, the controlled energy storage and return (CESR) foot, and observed the effect on gait. Subjects walked on the CESR foot with three different springs. We performed parallel studies on amputees and on non-amputees wearing prosthetic simulators. In both groups, spring characteristics similarly affected ankle and body center-of-mass (COM) mechanics and metabolic cost. Softer springs led to greater energy storage, energy return, and prosthetic limb COM push-off work. But metabolic energy expenditure was lowest with a spring of intermediate stiffness, suggesting biomechanical disadvantages to the softest spring despite its greater push-off. Disadvantages of the softest spring may include excessive heel displacements and COM collision losses. We also observed some differences in joint kinetics between amputees and non-amputees walking on the prototype foot. During prosthetic push-off, amputees exhibited reduced energy transfer from the prosthesis to the COM along with increased hip work, perhaps due to greater energy dissipation at the knee. Nevertheless, the results indicate that spring compliance can contribute to push-off, but with biomechanical trade-offs that limit the degree to which greater push-off might improve walking economy.},

In order to evaluate the mechanical properties as well as thermal properties correctly, random based foam structure must be modeled close to real 3-D foam geometry as much as possible. In this paper, 3-D geometry of micro-cellular carbon foam is modeled in computer aided design (CAD) environment by using special scripts written for capturing real topology of carbon foams. Then, finite element stress analyses are carried out to obtain effective mechanical properties such as compressive Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. It is shown that finite element results are in close agreement with the results in literature.},

abstract = {Dynamic joint stiffness determines the relation between joint position and torque, and plays a vital role in the control of posture and movement. Dynamic joint stiffness can be quantified during quasi-stationary conditions using disturbance experiments, where small position perturbations are applied to the joint and the torque response is recorded. Dynamic joint stiffness is composed of intrinsic and reflex mechanisms that act and change together, so that nonlinear, mathematical models and specialized system identification techniques are necessary to estimate their relative contributions to overall joint stiffness.Quasi-stationary experiments have demonstrated that dynamic joint stiffness is heavilymodulated by joint position and voluntary torque.Consequently, during movement, when joint position and torque change rapidly, dynamic joint stiffness will be Time-Varying (TV). This paper introduces a new method to quantify the TV intrinsic and reflex components of dynamic joint stiffness during movement. The algorithm combines ensemble and deterministic approaches for estimation of TV systems; and uses a TV, parallel-cascade, nonlinear system identification technique to separate overall dynamic joint stiffness into intrinsic and reflex components from position and torque records. Simulation studies of a stiffnessmodel,whose parameters variedwith time as is expected during walking, demonstrated that the new algorithm accurately tracked the changes in dynamic joint stiffness using as little as 40 gait cycles. The method was also used to estimate the intrinsic and reflex dynamic ankle stiffness froman experimentwith a healthy subject during which ankle movements were imposed while the subject maintained a constant muscle contraction. The method identified TV stiffness model parameters that predicted the measured torque very well, accounting for more than 95{\%} of its variance. Moreover, both intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness were heavilymodulated through the movement in a manner that could not be predicted from quasi-stationary experiments. The new method provides the tool needed to explore the role of dynamic stiffness in the control of movement.},

This review article describes the state of the art in the design of actuators with adaptable passive compliance. This new type of actuator is not preferred for classical position-controlled applications such as pick and place operations but is preferred in novel robots where safe human- robot interaction is required or in applications where energy efficiency must be increased by adapting the actuator's resonance frequency. The working principles of the different existing designs are explained and compared. The designs are divided into four groups: equilibrium-controlled stiffness, antagonistic-controlled stiffness, structure-controlled stiffness (SCS), and mechanically controlled stiffness.},

abstract = {Transtibial amputees are at an increased risk of falling compared to age-matched, able-bodied individuals. The aim of this study was to compare the gait patterns of recent amputee fallers vs. non-fallers during level walking by investigating joint kinematics, kinetics and variability of temporal–spatial parameters. Eleven participants (fallers=6; non-fallers=5) walked along a 10-m walkway at their self-selected pace while three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected. The fallers had a significantly greater first peak vertical GRF (p=0.01) and load rate on the prosthetic limb than the non-fallers (p=0.03). Joint range of motion was similar between the two groups. Joint moment profiles were similar for the ankle and hip, with more noticeable differences at the knee. On the intact limb, the fallers also showed significantly smaller A1 and larger H2 power bursts and greater variability of swing time duration compared to the non-fallers. The non-fallers had a smaller load rate and knee moment that remained extensor suggesting they could make compensatory adjustments to maintain stability on the prosthetic side by modifying muscular demands of the knee extensors. This research suggests that falls prevention and prosthetic rehabilitation programmes should focus on improving knee muscle strength of the prosthetic limb, and eccentric ankle and hip strength of the intact limb, to improve stability and progression, particularly during weight transfer onto single support of the prosthetic limb.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to understand the macroscopic mechanical structure and function of biological muscle with respect to its dynamic role in the contraction. A recently published muscle model, deriving the hyperbolic force-velocity relation from first-order mechanical principles, predicts different force-velocity operating points for different load situations. With a new approach, this model could be simplified and thus, transferred into a numerical simulation and a hardware experiment. Two types of quick release experiments were performed in simulation and with the hardware setup, which represent two extreme cases of the contraction dynamics: against a constant force (isotonic) and against an inertial mass. Both experiments revealed hyperbolic or hyperbolic-like force-velocity relations. Interestingly, the analytical model not only predicts these extreme cases, but also additionally all contraction states in between. It was possible to validate these predictions with the numerical model and the hardware experiment. These results prove that the origin of the hyperbolic force-velocity relation can be mechanically explained on a macroscopic level by the dynamical interaction of three mechanical elements. The implications for the interpretation of biological muscle experiments and the realization of muscle-like bionic actuators are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMAs) belong to a class of shape memory materials (SMMs), which have the ability to ‘memorise' or retain their previous form when subjected to certain stimulus such as thermomechanical or magnetic variations. SMAs have drawn significant attention and interest in recent years in a broad range of commercial applications, due to their unique and superior properties; this commercial development has been supported by fundamental and applied research studies. This work describes the attributes of SMAs that make them ideally suited to actuators in various applications, and addresses their associated limitations to clarify the design challenges faced by SMA developers. This work provides a timely review of recent SMA research and commercial applications, with over 100 state-of-the-art patents; which are categorised against relevant commercial domains and rated according to design objectives of relevance to these domains (particularly automotive, aerospace, robotic and biomedical). Although this work presents an extensive review of SMAs, other categories of SMMs are also discussed; including a historical overview, summary of recent advances and new application opportunities.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Background A musculoskeletal model for the ankle complex is vital in order to enhance the understanding of neuro-mechanical control of ankle motions, diagnose ankle disorders and assess subsequent treatments. Motions at the human ankle and foot, however, are complex due to simultaneous movements at the two joints namely, the ankle joint and the subtalar joint. The musculoskeletal elements at the ankle complex, such as ligaments, muscles and tendons, have intricate arrangements and exhibit transient and nonlinear behaviour. Methods This paper develops a musculoskeletal model of the ankle complex considering the biaxial ankle structure. The model provides estimates of overall mechanical characteristics (motion and moments) of ankle complex through consideration of forces applied along ligaments and muscle-tendon units. The dynamics of the ankle complex and its surrounding ligaments and muscle-tendon units is modelled and formulated into a state space model to facilitate simulations. A graphical user interface is also developed during this research in order to include the visual anatomical information by converting it to quantitative information on coordinates. Findings Validation of the ankle model was carried out by comparing its outputs with those published in literature as well as with experimental data obtained from an existing parallel ankle rehabilitation robot. Interpretation Qualitative agreement was observed between the model and measured data for both, the passive and active ankle motions during trials in terms of displacements and moments.},

abstract = {The effect of increased walking speed on temporal and loading asymmetry was investigated in highly active trans-femoral and trans-tibial amputees. With increasing walking speed, temporal gait variables reduced in duration, particularly on the prosthetic limb, while vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) increased in magnitude, particularly on the intact limb. Thus, temporal asymmetry reduced and loading asymmetry increased with walking speed. The greater force on the intact limb may reflect the method by which the amputees achieve greater temporal symmetry in order to walk fast, and could possibly account for greater instances of joint degeneration in the intact limb reported in the literature.},

abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces use neuronal activity recorded from the brain to establish direct communication with external actuators, such as prosthetic arms. It is hoped that brain-machine interfaces can be used to restore the normal sensorimotor functions of the limbs, but so far they have lacked tactile sensation. Here we report the operation of a brain-machine-brain interface (BMBI) that both controls the exploratory reaching movements of an actuator and allows signalling of artificial tactile feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex. Monkeys performed an active exploration task in which an actuator (a computer cursor or a virtual-reality arm) was moved using a BMBI that derived motor commands from neuronal ensemble activity recorded in the primary motor cortex. ICMS feedback occurred whenever the actuator touched virtual objects. Temporal patterns of ICMS encoded the artificial tactile properties of each object. Neuronal recordings and ICMS epochs were temporally multiplexed to avoid interference. Two monkeys operated this BMBI to search for and distinguish one of three visually identical objects, using the virtual-reality arm to identify the unique artificial texture associated with each. These results suggest that clinical motor neuroprostheses might benefit from the addition of ICMS feedback to generate artificial somatic perceptions associated with mechanical, robotic or even virtual prostheses.},

abstract = {Impaired control of mediolateral body motion during walking is an important health concern. Developing treatments to improve mediolateral control is challenging, partly because the mechanisms by which muscles modulate mediolateral ground reaction force (and thereby modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center) during unimpaired walking are poorly understood. To investigate this, we examined mediolateral ground reaction forces in eight unimpaired subjects walking at four speeds and determined the contributions of muscles, gravity, and velocity-related forces to the mediolateral ground reaction force by analyzing muscle-driven simulations of these subjects. During early stance (0-6{\%} gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the leading foot was directed laterally and increased significantly (p{\textless}0.05) with walking speed. During early single support (14-30{\%} gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the stance foot was directed medially and increased significantly (p{\textless}0.01) with speed. Muscles accounted for more than 92{\%} of the mediolateral ground reaction force over all walking speeds, whereas gravity and velocity-related forces made relatively small contributions. Muscles coordinate mediolateral acceleration via an interplay between the medial ground reaction force contributed by the abductors and the lateral ground reaction forces contributed by the knee extensors, plantarflexors, and adductors. Our findings show how muscles that contribute to forward progression and body-weight support also modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center while weight is transferred from one leg to another during double support.},

abstract = {We review and re-examine the description and separation of the spin and orbital angular momenta (AM) of an electromagnetic field in free space. While the spin and orbital AM of light are not separately-meaningful physical quantities in orthodox quantum mechanics or classical field theory, these quantities are routinely measured and used for applications in optics. A meaningful quantum description of the spin and orbital AM of light was recently provided by several authors, which describes separately conserved and measurable integral values of these quantities. However, the electromagnetic field theory still lacks corresponding locally-conserved spin and orbital AM currents. In this paper, we construct these missing local spin and orbital AM densities and fluxes that satisfy the proper continuity equations. We show that these are physically measurable and conserved quantities. These are, however, not Lorentz-covariant, so only make sense in the single laboratory reference frame of the measurement probe. The fluxes we derive improve the canonical (non-conserved) spin and orbital AM fluxes, and include a `spin-orbit' term that describes the spin-orbit interaction effects observed in nonparaxial optical fields. We also consider both standard and dual-symmetric versions of the electromagnetic field theory. Applying the general theory to nonparaxial optical vortex beams validates our results and allows us to discriminate between earlier approaches to the problem. Our treatment yields the complete and consistent description of the spin and orbital AM of free Maxwell fields in both quantum-mechanical and field-theory approaches.},

This paper analyzes the beginning of the medical education research process, when the investigator develops awareness of a problem that generates questions which, in turn, beget the search for answers. The research question is a structured approach to the uncertainty surrounding an educational problem, which the investigator attempts to clarify; this uncertainty is related to a knowledge gap in educational reality, or after an unexplained contradiction. The purposes of the research question are reviewed, and reflections are made about the challenges of its writing and structuring. Three approaches are used as examples: the structural aspects of an educational activity (who, when, where, what, how and why); the “PICOT' strategy, similar to the method used in evidence-based medicine; and the systematic method proposed by Bordage and Dawson with nine questions. It is recommended to evaluate research questions with the following criteria: feasibility, interest, novelty, ethics and relevance. The suggested approaches have common and complementary elements, so each investigator should select the method that is more appropriate to his/her needs or objectives, given that the research process is not a rigid “cookbook' approach, but rather a creative and complex chain of reasoning that has no fixed limits or specific linear routes.},

abstract = {An optimization-based formulation and solution method are presented to predict asymmetric human gait for a large-scale skeletal model. Predictive dynamics approach is used in which both the joint angles and joint torques are treated as unknowns in the equations of motion. For the optimization formulation, the joint angle profiles are treated as the primary unknowns, and velocities and accelerations are calculated using them. In numerical implementation, the joint angle profiles are discretized using the B-spline interpolation. An algorithm is presented to inversely calculate the joint torques and the ground reaction forces. The sum of the joint-torques squared, called the dynamic effort, is minimized as the human performance measure. Constraints are imposed on the joint strengths (torques) and joint ranges of motion along with other physical constraints. The formulation is validated by simulating a symmetric gait and comparing the results with the experimental data. Then asymmetric gait motion is simulated, where the left and right step lengths are different. The kinematics and kinetics results from the simulation are presented and discussed. Predicted ground reaction forces are explained by using the inverted pendulum model. Predicted kinematics and kinetics have trends that are similar to those reported in the literature. Potential practical applications of the formulation and the solution approach are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Movement science is driven by observation, but observation alone cannot elucidate principles of human and animal movement. Biomechanical modeling and computer simulation complement observations and inform experimental design. Biological models are complex and specialized software is required for building, validating, and studying them. Furthermore, common access is needed so that investigators can contribute models to a broader community and leverage past work. We are developing OpenSim, a freely available musculoskeletal modeling and simulation application and libraries specialized for these purposes, by providing: musculoskeletal modeling elements, such as biomechanical joints, muscle actuators, ligament forces, compliant contact, and controllers; and tools for fitting generic models to subject-specific data, performing inverse kinematics and forward dynamic simulations. OpenSim performs an array of physics-based analyses to delve into the behavior of musculoskeletal models by employing Simbody, an efficient and accurate multibody system dynamics code. Models are publicly available and are often reused for multiple investigations because they provide a rich set of behaviors that enables different lines of inquiry. This report will discuss one model developed to study walking and applied to gain deeper insights into muscle function in pathological gait and during running. We then illustrate how simulations can test fundamental hypotheses and focus the aims of in vivo experiments, with a postural stability platform and human model that provide a research environment for performing human posture experiments in silico. We encourage wide adoption of OpenSim for community exchange of biomechanical models and methods and welcome new contributors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Several robotic devices have been developed for the rehabilitation of treadmill walking in patients with movement disorders due to injuries or diseases of the central nervous system. These robots induce coordinated multi-joint movements aimed at reproducing the physiological walking or stepping patterns. Control strategies developed for robotic locomotor training need a set of predefined lower limb joint angular trajectories as reference input for the control algorithm. Such trajectories are typically taken from normative database of overground unassisted walking. However, it has been demonstrated that gait speed and the amount of body weight support significantly influence joint trajectories during walking. Moreover, both the speed and the level of body weight support must be individually adjusted according to the rehabilitation phase and the residual locomotor abilities of the patient. In this work, 10 healthy participants (age range: 23–48 years) were asked to walk in movement analysis laboratory on a ...},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the ankle joint during level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent to determine models for use in the design of prosthetic and orthotic systems. Ten healthy subjects were asked to walk (1) across a level walkway, (2) up, and (3) down an instrumented stairway. Sagittal plane kinematic and kinetic data were analyzed to obtain ankle biomechanics during the stance phase of each task. Each stance phase was broken down into sub-phases based on the power trajectory. The ideal model was taken to be the simplest combination of mechanical elements (springs, dampers, and torque actuators) that could reproduce the patterns observed in ankle biomechanics. Besides, we studied the transitions from level walking to stair ascent and from stair descent to level walking and showed that mechanical elements can be used to model these transitions as well. These results are promising to the design of next generation ankle orthotic and prosthetic systems because they show that relatively simple mechanical elements can be utilized to mimic ankle biomechanics.},

abstract = {Evidence from biomechanics research suggests that tendon series elasticity allows muscle to act in an optimal range of its force-length and force-velocity curves to achieve work and power amplification. In this investigation we put forth a simple model to quantify the capacity of series elasticity to increase work and power output from an actuator. We show that an appropriate spring constant increases the energy that an actuator can deliver to a mass by a factor of 4. The series elasticity changes the actuator operating point along its force-velocity curve and therefore affects the actuator work output over a fixed stroke length. In addition, the model predicts that a series spring can store energy and deliver peak powers greater than the power limit of the source by a factor of 1.4. Preliminary experiments are performed to test model predictions. We find qualitative agreement between the model and experimental data, highlighting the importance of series elasticity for actuator work and power amplification across a fixed stroke length. We present several non-dimensional relations that can aid designers in the fabrication of robotic and prosthetic limbs optimized for work and power delivery. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Control schemes for powered ankle-foot prostheses rely upon fixed torque-ankle state relationships obtained from measurements of intact humans walking at target speeds and across known terrains. Although effective at their intended gait speed and terrain, these controllers do not allow for adaptation to environmental disturbances such as speed transients and terrain variation. Here we present an adaptive muscle-reflex controller, based on simulation studies, that utilizes an ankle plantar flexor comprising a Hill-type muscle with a positive force feedback reflex. The model's parameters were fitted to match the human ankle's torque-angle profile as obtained from level-ground walking measurements of a weight and height-matched intact subject walking at 1 m/s. Using this single parameter set, clinical trials were conducted with a transtibial amputee walking on level ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent conditions. During these trials, an adaptation of prosthetic ankle work was observed in response to ground slope variation, in a manner comparable to intact subjects, without the difficulties of explicit terrain sensing. Specifically, the energy provided by the prosthesis was directly correlated to the ground slope angle. This study highlights the importance of neuromuscular controllers for enhancing the adaptiveness of powered prosthetic devices across varied terrain surfaces.},

abstract = {The compressive behavior of nanocomposite foams is studied by both experimental and computational micro-mechanics approaches with the aim of providing an efficient computational model for this kind of material. The nanocomposites based on polypropylene (PP) and different contents of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are prepared by melt mixing method. The nanocomposite samples are foamed using super-critical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) as blowing agent at different soaking temperatures. The influence of this foaming parameter on the morphological characteristics of the foam micro-structure is discussed. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements are used to quantify the crystallinity degree of both nanocomposites and foams showing that the crystallinity degree is reduced after the foaming process. This modification leads to mechanical properties of the foam cell walls that are different from the raw nanocomposite PP/CNTs material. Three-point bending tests are performed on the latter to measure the flexural modulus in terms of the crystallinity degree. Uniaxial compression tests are then performed on the foamed samples under quasi-static conditions in order to extract the macro-scale compressive response. Next, a two-level multi-scale approach is developed to model the behavior of the foamed nanocomposite material. On the one hand, the micro-mechanical properties of nanocomposite PP/CNTs cell walls are evaluated from a theoretical homogenization model accounting for the micro-structure of the semi-crystalline PP, for the degree of crystallinity, and for the CNT volume fraction. The applicability of this theoretical model is demonstrated via the comparison with experimental data from the described experimental measurements and from literature. On the other hand, the macroscopic behavior of the foamed material is evaluated using a computational micro-mechanics model using tetrakaidecahedron unit cells and periodic boundary conditions to estimate the homogenized properties. The unit cell is combined with several geometrical imperfections in order to capture the elastic collapse of the foamed material. The numerical results are compared to the experimental measurements and it is shown that the proposed unit cell computational micro-mechanics model can be used to estimate the homogenized behavior, including the linear and plateau regimes, of nanocomposite foams.},

abstract = {Over the last half-century, the field of prosthetic engineering has continuously evolved with much attention being dedicated to restoring the mechanical energy properties of ankle joint musculatures during gait. However, the contributions of 'distal foot structures' (e.g., foot muscles, plantar soft tissue) have been overlooked. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the total mechanical energy profiles (e.g., power, work, and work-ratio) of the natural ankle-foot system (NAFS) by combining the contributions of the ankle joint and all distal foot structures during stance in level-ground steady state walking across various speeds (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 statures/s). The results from eleven healthy subjects walking barefoot indicated ankle joint and distal foot structures generally performed opposing roles: the ankle joint performed net positive work that systematically increased its energy generation with faster walking speeds, while the distal foot performed net negative work that systematically increased its energy absorption with faster walking speeds. Accounting for these simultaneous effects, the combined ankle-foot system exhibited increased work-ratios with faster walking. Most notably, the work-ratio was not significantly greater than 1.0 during the normal walking speed of 0.8 statures/s. Therefore, a prosthetic design that strategically exploits passive-dynamic properties (e.g., elastic energy storage and return) has the potential to replicate the mechanical energy profiles of the NAFS during level-ground steady-state walking.},

abstract = {Prosthetic feet are designed to store energy during early stance and then release a portion of that energy during late stance. The usefulness of providing more energy return depends on whether or not that energy transfers up the lower limb to aid in whole body propulsion. This research examined how increasing prosthetic foot energy return affected walking mechanics across various slopes. Five people with a uni-lateral transtibial amputation walked on an instrumented treadmill at 1.1 m/s for three conditions (level ground, +7.5°, -7.5°) while wearing a prosthetic foot with a novel linkage system and a traditional energy storage and return foot. The novel foot demonstrated greater range of motion (p = 0.0012), and returned more energy (p = 0.023) compared to the traditional foot. The increased energy correlated with an increase in center of mass (CoM) energy change during propulsion from the prosthetic limb (p = 0.012), and the increased prosthetic limb propulsion correlated to a decrease in CoM energy change (i.e., collision) on the sound limb (p {\textless} 0.001). These data indicate that this novel foot was able to return more energy than a traditional prosthetic foot and that this additional energy was used to increase whole body propulsion.},

The predictive approach also holds great promise, but has seen limited use in clinical applications. Enhanced software tools would facilitate the application of predictive musculoskeletal simulations to clinically-relevant research. The open-source software OpenSim provides tools for generating tracking simulations but not predictive simulations. However, OpenSim includes an extensive application programming interface that permits extending its capabilities with scripting languages such as MATLAB. In the work presented here, we combine the computational tools provided by MATLAB with the musculoskeletal modeling capabilities of OpenSim to create a framework for generating predictive simulations of musculoskeletal movement based on direct collocation optimal control techniques. In many cases, the direct collocation approach can be used to solve optimal control problems considerably faster than traditional shooting methods. Cyclical and discrete movement problems were solved using a simple 1 degree of freedom musculoskeletal model and a model of the human lower limb, respectively. The problems could be solved in reasonable amounts of time (several seconds to 1–2 hours) using the open-source IPOPT solver. The problems could also be solved using the fmincon solver that is included with MATLAB, but the computation times were excessively long for all but the smallest of problems. The performance advantage for IPOPT was derived primarily by exploiting sparsity in the constraints Jacobian. The framework presented here provides a powerful and flexible approach for generating optimal control simulations of musculoskeletal movement using OpenSim and MATLAB. This should allow researchers to more readily use predictive simulation as a tool to address clinical conditions that limit human mobility.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Contemporary prosthetic feet are generally optimized for either daily or high-level activities. Prosthesis users, therefore, often require multiple prostheses to participate in activities that span a range of mobility. Crossover feet (XF) are designed to increase the range of activities that can be performed with a single prosthesis. However, little evidence exists to guide clini-cal prescription of XF relative to traditional energy storing feet (ESF). The objective of this study was to assess the effects of XF and ESF on health outcomes in people with transtibial amputation. A randomized crossover study was conducted to assess changes in laboratory-based (endurance, perceived exertion, walking performance) and community-based (step activity and self-reported mobility, fatigue, balance confidence, activity restrictions, and sat-isfaction) outcomes. Twenty-seven participants were fit with XF and ESF prostheses with standardized sockets, interfaces, and suspensions. Participants were not blinded to the intervention, and wore each prosthesis for one month while their steps were counted with an activity monitor. After each accommodation period, participants returned for data collection. Endurance and perceived exertion were measured with the Six-Minute Walk Test and Borg-CR100, respectively. Walking performance was measured using an electronic walkway. Self-reported mobility, fatigue, balance confidence, activity restrictions, and satisfaction were measured with survey instruments. Participants also reported foot preferences upon conclusion of the study. Differences between feet were assessed with a crossover analysis. While using XF, users experienced improvements in most community-based outcomes, including mobility (p = .001), fatigue (p = .001), balance confidence (p = .005), activity restrictions (p = .002), and functional satisfaction (p {\textless} .001). Participants also exhibited lon-ger sound side steps in XF compared to ESF (p {\textless} .001). Most participants (89{\%}) reported an overall preference for XF; others (11{\%}) reported no preference. Results indicate that XF may be a promising alternative to ESF for people with transtibial amputation who engage in a range of mobility activities.},

abstract = {Background The increased injury risk in older runners has been associated with alterations in muscle strength, flexibility, and gait biomechanics. This study investigated whether older runners exhibit changes in muscle strength, flexibility and running biomechanics compared to younger runners, and possible relationships between these changes. Methods Thirty-five young (20-36 yrs) and 35 older (55-71 yrs) recreational runners participated in the study. Measures of three-dimensional biomechanical data during treadmill running at 2.7 m/s and measures of muscle strength and flexibility were compared between groups. A correlation analysis between biomechanical and clinical variables was also performed. Findings Older runners demonstrated an overall reduction in muscle strength and flexibility, and altered running patterns compared to young runners but correlations between clinical and biomechanical variables were scarce. Reduced hip, ankle and trunk excursions along with reduced knee and ankle positive work were found in older runners. Older runners also exhibited increased knee abduction impulse, ankle abduction impulse and vertical loading rates. In contrast, older runners did not present a distal-to-proximal lower extremity joint moment redistribution. Interpretation We observed age-related reduced strength and flexibility concomitant with alterations in running biomechanics, but a lack of correlation between these variables. This finding hampers the use of single, or even a subset of characteristics to better understand age-related changes in runners. The observed changes are complex and multivariate in nature. Clinicians will most likely have to monitor both clinical and biomechanical characteristics to optimize care. However, future studies need to prospectively address what are biomechanical age-related risk factors in runners. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present a powered knee prosthesis with two series-elastic actuators positioned in parallel in an agonist-antagonist arrangement. To motivate the knee's design, we developed a prosthetic knee model that comprises a variable damper and two series-elastic clutch units that span the knee joint. Using human gait data to constrain the model's joint to move biologically, we varied model parameters using an optimization scheme that minimized the sum over time of the squared difference between the model's joint torque and biological knee values. We then used these optimized values to specify the mechanical and control design of the prosthesis for level-ground walking. We hypothesized that a variable-impedance control design could produce humanlike knee mechanics during steady-state level-ground walking. As a preliminary evaluation of this hypothesis, we compared the prosthetic knee mechanics of an amputee walking at a self-selected gait speed with those of a weight- and height-matched nonamputee. We found qualitative agreement between prosthetic and human knee mechanics. Because the knee's motors never perform positive work on the knee joint throughout the level-ground gait cycle, the knee's electrical power requirement is modest in walking (8 W), decreasing the size of the onboard battery required to power the prosthesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent research has focused on the design of intelligent prosthetic ankle devices with the goal of adapting behavior of the device to accommodate all walking surfaces that an individual encounters in daily life. To date, no studies have looked at how such devices perform on uneven terrain.

METHODS: 11 young adults with unilateral transtibial amputation participated in two data collection sessions spaced approximately 3 weeks apart. In each session they walked across a loose rock surface at three controlled speeds. In the first session, they wore a passive, energy storage and return prosthesis and in the second, they wore a powered prosthesis (BiOM, iWalk, Bedford, MA, USA).

FINDINGS: Subjects had a 10{\%} faster self-selected walking speed when wearing the powered (1.16 m/s) compared to unpowered prosthesis (1.05 m/s; p=0.031). They walked with increased ankle plantarflexion on their prosthetic limb throughout the gait cycle when wearing the powered compared to unpowered prosthesis. This was especially evident in the increased plantarflexion during push-off (p{\textless}0.001). There was a small ({\textless}3°), but statistically significant decrease in knee flexion during early stance when wearing the powered device (p=0.045). Otherwise, the kinematics of the knee and hip were nearly identical when wearing the different devices. Subjects had decreased medial-lateral motion of their center of mass when wearing the powered prosthesis (p=0.020), but there were no differences in medial-lateral margins of stability between the devices (p=0.662).

INTERPRETATION: Subjects did not significantly alter their proximal joint kinematics on this irregular surface as a result of the addition of power.},

abstract = {Lower extremity amputation not only limits mobility, but also increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis of the intact limb. Dynamic walking models of non-amputees suggest that pushing-off from the trailing limb can reduce collision forces on the leading limb. These collision forces may determine the peak knee external adduction moment (EAM), which has been linked to the development of knee OA in the general population. We therefore hypothesized that greater prosthetic push-off would lead to reduced loading and knee EAM of the intact limb in unilateral transtibial amputees. Seven unilateral transtibial amputees were studied during gait under three prosthetic foot conditions that were intended to vary push-off. Prosthetic foot-ankle push-off work, intact limb knee EAM and ground reaction impulses for both limbs during step-to-step transition were measured. Overall, trailing limb prosthetic push-off work was negatively correlated with leading intact limb 1st peak knee EAM (slope=−.72±.22; p=.011). Prosthetic push-off work and 1st peak intact knee EAM varied significantly with foot type. The prosthetic foot condition with the least push-off demonstrated the largest knee EAM, which was reduced by 26{\%} with the prosthetic foot producing the most push-off. Trailing prosthetic limb push-off impulse was negatively correlated with leading intact limb loading impulse (slope=−.34±.14; p=.001), which may help explain how prosthetic limb push-off can affect intact limb loading. Prosthetic feet that perform more prosthetic push-off appear to be associated with a reduction in 1st peak intact knee EAM, and their use could potentially reduce the risk and burden of knee osteoarthritis in this population.},

When the predicted walking speed is slow, the characteristics of the apparatus are then modified so that less net-work that is performed during that step (as compared to when the predicted walking speed is fast). This may be implemented using one sensor from which the walking speed can be predicted, and a second sensor from which ankle torque can be determined. A controller receives inputs from those sensors, and controls a motor's torque so that the torque for slow walking speeds is lower than the torque for fast walking speeds. This reduces the work performed by the actuator over a gait cycle and the peak actuator power delivered during the gait cycle. In some embodiments, a series elastic element is connected in series with a motor that can drive the ankle, and at least one sensor is provided with an output from which a deflection of the series elastic element can be determined. A controller determines a desired torque based on the output, and controls the motor's torque based on the determined desired torque.},

abstract = {Welcome to Clever Algorithms! This is a handbook of recipes for com- putational problem solving techniques from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics. Clever Algorithms are interesting, practical, and fun to learn about and implement. Research scientists may be interested in browsing algorithm inspirations in search of an interesting system or process analogs to investigate. Developers and software engineers may compare various problem solving algorithms and technique-specific guidelines. Practitioners, students, and interested amateurs may implement state-of-the-art algorithms to address business or scientific needs, or simply play with the fascinating systems they represent. This introductory chapter provides relevant background information on Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms. The core of the book provides a large corpus of algorithms presented in a complete and consistent manner. The final chapter covers some advanced topics to consider once a number of algorithms have been mastered. This book has been designed as a reference text, where specific techniques are looked up, or where the algorithms across whole fields of study can be browsed, rather than being read cover-to-cover. This book is an algorithm handbook and a technique guidebook, and I hope you find something useful.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This study investigated spatio-temporal variables, ground reaction forces and sagittal and frontal plane kinematics during the stance phase of nine trained subjects running barefoot and shod at three different velocities (3.5, 4.5, 5.5ms-1). Differences between conditions were detected with the general linear method (factorial model). Barefoot running is characterized by a significantly larger external loading rate than the shod condition. The flatter foot placement at touchdown is prepared in free flight, implying an actively induced adaptation strategy. In the barefoot condition, plantar pressure measurements reveal a flatter foot placement to correlate with lower peak heel pressures. Therefore, it is assumed that runners adopt this different touchdown geometry in barefoot running in an attempt to limit the local pressure underneath the heel. A significantly higher leg stiffness during the stance phase was found for the barefoot condition. The sagittal kinematic adaptations between conditions were found in the same way for all subjects and at the three running velocities. However, large individual variations were observed between the runners for the rearfoot kinematics. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Recreational running has many proven benefits which include increased cardiovascular, physical and mental health. It is no surprise that Running USA reported over 10 million individuals completed running road races in 2009 not to mention recreational joggers who do not wish to compete in organized events. Unfortunately there are numerous risks associated with running, the most common being musculoskeletal injuries attributed to incorrect shoe choice, training errors and excessive shoe wear or other biomechanical factors associated with ground reaction forces. Approximately 65{\%} of chronic injuries in distance runners are related to routine high mileage, rapid increases in mileage, increased intensity, hills or irregular surface running, and surface firmness. Humans have been running barefooted or wearing minimally supportive footwear such as moccasins or sandals since the beginning of time while modernized running shoes were not invented until the 1970s. However, the current trend is that many runners are moving back to barefoot running or running in "minimal" shoes. The goal of this masterclass article is to examine the similarities and differences between shod and unshod (barefoot or minimally supportive running shoes) runners by examining spatiotemporal parameters, energetics, and biomechanics. These running parameters will be compared and contrasted with walking. The most obvious difference between the walking and running gait cycle is the elimination of the double limb support phase of walking gait in exchange for a float (no limb support) phase. The biggest difference between barefoot and shod runners is at the initial contact phase of gait where the barefoot and minimally supported runner initiates contact with their forefoot or midfoot instead of the rearfoot. As movement science experts, physical therapists are often called upon to assess the gait of a running athlete, their choice of footwear, and training regime. With a clearer understanding of running and its complexities, the physical therapist will be able to better identify faults and create informed treatment plans while rehabilitating patients who are experiencing musculoskeletal injuries due to running. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In human walking, the center of mass motion is similar to an inverted pendulum. Viewing double support as a transition from one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method). Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work were approximately 33{\%} less than those calculated using the individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs greater than 97{\%} of the double support positive work while the leading leg performs greater than 94{\%} of the double support negative work.},

The resulting homogenized properties are then used assuming uniform distribution of the cellular structure to compute the macroscale structure. Results are presented that illustrate the fine-scale stresses developed in the macroscale optimized part as well as the effect that fine-scale structure has on the optimized topology. Finally, a new method is presented for generating an STL representation of the optimized part that is suitable for printing on typical industrial machines.

abstract = {Virtual testing using dynamic finite element simulations is an efficient way to investigate the mechanical behaviour of small- and large-scale structures reducing time- and cost-expensive prototype tests. Furthermore, numerical models allow for efficient parameter studies or optimisations. One example, which is the focus of this paper, is the configurational design of cellular sandwich core structures. From classical honeycomb cores to innovative folded core structures, a relatively large design space is provided allowing for tailoring of the cellular core geometry with respect to the desired properties. The method of determining the effective mechanical properties of such cellular sandwich core structures of different geometries using dynamic compression, tensile and shear test simulations is discussed covering a number of important modelling aspects: the cell wall material modelling, the influence of mesh size and number of unit cells, the inclusion of imperfections, etc. A comparison of numerical and experimental results is given for Nomex{\textregistered} honeycomb cores and Kevlar{\textregistered} or carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) foldcore structures. A good correlation with respect to cell wall deformation mechanisms and stress–strain data was obtained. Therefore, these models not only allow for a complete mechanical characterisation of cellular core structures but also for a detailed investigation of cell wall deformation patterns and failure modes to get a better understanding of the structural behaviour, which can be difficult using solely experimental observations. To show that this efficient virtual testing method is suitable for the development of cellular core geometries for specific requirements, an optimisation study of a CFRP foldcore geometry with respect to its compressive behaviour was performed.},

abstract = {A monoarticular series elastic actuator (SEA) reduces energetic and peak power requirements compared to a direct drive (DD) in active prosthetic ankle-foot design. Simulation studies have shown that similar advantages are possible for the knee joint. The aims of this paper were to investigate the advantages of a monoarticular SEA-driven hip joint and to quantify the energetic benefit of an SEA-driven leg (with monoarticular hip, knee and ankle SEAs), assuming that damping (negative power) is passively achieved. The hip SEA provided minor energetic advantages in walking (up to 29{\%}) compared to the knee and the ankle SEA. Reductions in required peak power were observed only for speeds close to preferred walking speed (18{\%} to 27{\%}). No energetic advantages were found in running, where a DD achieved the best performance when optimizing for energy. Using an SEA at each leg joint in the sagittal plane reduced the positive work by 14{\%} to 39{\%} for walking and by 37{\%} to 75{\%} for running. When using an SEA instead of a DD, the contribution of the three leg joints to doing positive work changed: the knee contributed less and the hip more positive work. For monoarticular SEAs, the ankle joint motor did most of the positive work.},

abstract = {Patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms are becoming available with the advent of additive manufacturing. Phantoms currently in use are focused on the geometrical accuracy and mechanical properties under small deformation. Mimicking the mechanical properties at large deformation is challenging because of the inherent difference between the mechanical behaviors of polymeric materials and that of human tissues. In this study, the mechanical behavior of soft tissues under a uniaxial tension is mimicked by dual-material 3D printed meta-materials with stiff micro-structured fibers embedded in a soft polymeric matrix. Although the two base materials are strain-softening polymers, some of the designed meta-materials demonstrate certain degree of strain-stiffening behavior. Further investigation shows how the stress-strain curve of the meta-materials can be controlled by the design parameters. Sensitivity analysis is used to study the effects of each parameter. General design guidelines are proposed based on the results of the experiments. Dual-material 3D printed meta-materials have great potential in fabricating patient-specific phantoms with accurate mechanical properties that are associated with the gender, age, ethnicity, and other physiological/pathological characteristics. Mechanically accurate phantoms can play an important role in a variety of biomedical applications, including validation of computational models, testing of medical devices, surgery planning, medical education and training, and doctor-patient interaction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare energy cost of walking (ECW) and prosthesis-related perceived mobility with the Marlo Anatomical Socket (MAS({\textregistered})) and the Ischial Containment (IC) Socket.

METHOD: Transfemoral (TF) amputees were enrolled in the study. ECW tests were conducted inside, in a hallway with a regular floor surface. Subjects had to walk back and forth on a 61m linear course at their own self-selected speed. Metabolic and heart rate data were collected during the walking test using a portable gas analyzer. All measurements were made at steady state (SS). The tests were performed first using the IC socket and then after 30 days of MAS({\textregistered}) use; the last test was carried out after 60 days of MAS({\textregistered}) use. The amputees were also administered the Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire Mobility Section (PEQ MS) at the first and the last test to assess perceived potential for mobility using the prosthesis.

RESULTS: Seven long-term prosthesis users were analyzed. Their mean age was 33.9±9.3 years; all were employed, active, and used IC sockets. At the third walking test, the ECW with the MAS({\textregistered}) was significantly lower than that with the IC socket (p=.016). PEQ MS data also improved significantly at the last evaluation (p{\textless}.018).

CONCLUSION: Results suggest that using the MAS({\textregistered}), lowering the ECW and improving PEQ MS, could be a valid prosthesis design for active TF amputees compared to their usual IC socket.},

This paper describes the development, modeling, parameter estimation and control of a robot capable of reproducing two degree-of-freedom hip motion in the sagittal plane. Hip vertical displacement and thigh angle motion profiles are applied to a transfemoral prosthesis attached to the robot. A treadmill is used as walking surface.

Given that non–R{\&}D–intensive sectors and firms used to be neglected both as innovators and innovation drivers by the mainstream innovation literature, this anthology reflects the latest research from different collaborative projects at Fraunhofer ISI. Although the presented research focuses on the German manufacturing industry, the results are broadly relevant, as they reflect economic and structural patterns that are likely present–to varying degrees–in other industrialised countries. For instance, other industrialised countries within and beyond the EU even have higher shares of non–R{\&}D–intensive firms and industries than Germany. Starting with an overview of the research from the past decade (Chap. 2), which has shown that non–R{\&}D–intensive sectors and firms play an important role in national competitiveness and innovativeness in developed economies, eight chapters have provided details from different analytical angles on the six leading research questions stated in the editorial of the book.},

These advancements are reflected in scientific articles, particularly in the most cited papers. This article aimed to identify the 100 top-cited articles in the field of limb prosthetics and to investigate their main characteristics. Articles related to the field of limb prosthetics and published in the Web of Knowledge database of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) from the period of 1980 to 2012. The 100 most cited articles in limb prosthetics were selected based on the citation index report. All types of articles except for proceedings and letters were included in the study. The study design and level of evidence were determined using Sackett's initial rules of evidence. The level of evidence was categorized either as a systematic review or meta-analysis, randomized controlled trial, cohort study, case-control study, case series, expert opinion, or design and development. The top cited articles in prosthetics were published from 1980 to 2012 with a citation range of 11 to 90 times since publication. The mean citation rate was 24.43 (SD 16.7) times. Eighty-four percent of the articles were original publications and were most commonly prospective (76{\%}) and case series studies (67{\%}) that used human subjects (96{\%}) providing level 4 evidence. Among the various fields, rehabilitation (47{\%}), orthopedics (29{\%}), and sport sciences (28{\%}) were the most common fields of study. The study established that studies conducted in North America and were written in English had the highest citations. Top cited articles primarily dealt with lower limb prosthetics, specifically, on transtibial and transradial prosthetic limbs. Majority of the articles were experimental studies.},

abstract = {Human upright locomotion emerged about 6 million years ago. It is achieved by a complex interaction of the biological infrastructure and the neural control. Bones, muscles, tendons, cen- tral nervous commands and reflex mechanisms interact to provide robust and efficient bipedal movement patterns like walking or running. Next to these locomotion tasks humans can also perform complex movements like climbing, dancing or jumping. Diseases or traumatic events may cause the loss of parts of the biological infrastructure or the ability to control the lower limbs. Thus an identification of the required framework helps to improve on the artificial lower limb design and the control for bipedal robots, exoskeletons, orthoses or prostheses. A first ar- tificial leg design was reported about 5000 years ago. After losing one leg in a battle an iron leg was fitted to Queen Vishpla to get her back on the battlefield. Since this time major changes in the structure, the material and the functionality led to improved prosthetic restoration of physically disabled. The characteristics of the biological leg structure are imitated by technical components. Using carbon fiber for the design of prosthetic feet made it possible to benefit from the elastic recoil like in the Achilles tendon in stance phase. Dampers in prosthetic knee joints are able to mimic eccentric muscle work during the gait cycle. Clutch-like mechanisms are used to lock the knee during stance. Such a function is comparable to isometric muscle work. Semi- active knee joints allow changes in damping ratio to adapt the mechanical joint properties to the requirements. Using integrated force or inertial sensors, movement tasks can be identified. An adaptation of damping to different walking speeds and conditions, such as walking inclines, declines, or climbing stairs is possible. All these developments permitted that amputees gait got closer to the natural human gait pattern. However, until the end of the 20th century prostheses were not able to reproduce concentric muscle work. External positive energy is required to compensate for energy losses during locomotion. For climbing stairs or walking inclines not only the ankle, but also the knee joint contributes net positive work to lift the body center of mass. To achieve desired joint motion, a power source like a motor would be required that can inject energy to mimic the concentric function of the muscle fascicles. The thesis comprises an analysis of joint requirements, it evaluates the current prosthetic de- sign approaches and develops models on artificial muscles to mimic lower limb biomechanics in walking and running. The developed models are biologically inspired, while motors represent the function of muscle fibers and springs represent the function of the tendons. These systems are optimized for criteria like minimum joint peak power or minimum required energy for the power source (motor). Results demonstrate that elastic elements can highly decrease the ac- tuator requirements. The springs are able to store energy in one phase of the gait cycle and to release it later when high peak power is required. Without the elastic assistance the reproduc- tion of human joint behavior is hardly possible using current motor technology. The optimized interaction of motor and elasticity is evaluated in walking and running, using a prototype of a powered ankle prosthesis (Walk-Run ankle, Springactive). Next to experiments with a non- amputee, where the prosthesis was fitted in parallel to the fixed healthy ankle joint (Bypass), also experiments with a female unilateral transtibial amputee were performed. The optimized model behavior was compared to experimental observations and showed good agreement.},

abstract = {Direct skeletal attachments for transfemoral amputees have been the subject of clinical trials since the early nineties. This method of attachment allows the amputee an unrestricted range of motion around the hip joint, better sitting comfort, improved sensory feedback through osseoperception, improved limb control and reduced soft tissue problems. However, the length of the rehabilitation period is perceived as a shortcoming by the amputees and the clinicians. The aim of the present study is to estimate the risk of failure during gait, for a patient with direct skeletal attachment of a femoral prosthesis, using finite element analysis (FEA). Material properties and loads were derived from subject-specific data and implant stability assumed secured by bone ingrowth into a porous implant surface. A simplified FEA was used to optimize the implant geometry with respect to load bearing capacity. The resulting geometry was then implemented in a subject-specific FE study. The results indicate that the risk of failure for the implant system is approximately three times greater than what can be expected for an intact femur. The main conclusion, based on the risk of failure factors calculated, is that it is likely that a porous-coated implant could be beneficial for osseointegrated fixation. It is also suggested that the proposed methodology can be used in future studies exploring the mechanical stability of osseointegrated fixation in the view of improving direct skeletal attachments for lower limb amputees.},

abstract = {Over time, leg prostheses have improved in design, but have been incapable of actively adapting to different walking velocities in a manner comparable to a biological limb. People with a leg amputation using such commercially available passive-elastic prostheses require significantly more metabolic energy to walk at the same velocities, prefer to walk slower and have abnormal biomechanics compared with non-amputees. A bionic prosthesis has been developed that emulates the function of a biological ankle during level-ground walking, specifically providing the net positive work required for a range of walking velocities. We compared metabolic energy costs, preferred velocities and biomechanical patterns of seven people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the bionic prosthesis and using their own passive-elastic prosthesis to those of seven non-amputees during level-ground walking. Compared with using a passive-elastic prosthesis, using the bionic prosthesis decreased metabolic cost by 8 per cent, increased trailing prosthetic leg mechanical work by 57 per cent and decreased the leading biological leg mechanical work by 10 per cent, on average, across walking velocities of 0.75–1.75 m s−1 and increased preferred walking velocity by 23 per cent. Using the bionic prosthesis resulted in metabolic energy costs, preferred walking velocities and biomechanical patterns that were not significantly different from people without an amputation.},

abstract = {In the past decades, researchers have deeply studied pathological and nonpathological gait to understand the human ankle function during walking. These efforts resulted in the development of new lower limb prosthetic devices aiming at raising the 3C-level (control, comfort, and cosmetics) of amputees. Thanks to the technological advances in engineering and mechatronics, challenges in the field of prosthetics have become an important source of interest for roboticists. Currently, most of the bionic feet are still on a research level but show promising results and a preview of tomorrow's commercial prosthetic devices. In this paper, the authors present the current state-of-the-art and the latest advances in propulsive bionic feet with its actuation principles. The context of this review study is outlined followed by a brief description of the basics in human biomechanics and criteria for new prosthetic designs. A new categorization based on the actuation principle of propulsive ankle-foot prostheses is proposed. Based on simulations, the general principles and benefits of each actuation method are explained. The corresponding latest advances in propulsive bionic feet are presented together with their main characteristics and scientific outcomes. The authors also propose to the reader a comparison analysis of the presented devices with a discussion of the general tendencies in new prosthetic feet.},

As the size of the fish increased the cycle frequency for maximum power output (fopt) decreased, from 12.5 Hz (13 cm fish) to 5 Hz (67 cm fish) (fopt= 1.67 L−0.52, where L is body length).},

abstract = {3D printing hardware is rapidly scaling up to output continuous mixtures of multiple materials at increasing resolution over ever larger print volumes. This poses an enormous computational chal- lenge: large high-resolution prints comprise trillions of voxels and petabytes of data and simply modeling and describing the input with spatially varying material mixtures at this scale is challeng- ing. Existing 3D printing software is insufficient; in particular, most software is designed to support only a few million primitives, with discrete material choices per object. We present OpenFab, a programmable pipeline for synthesis of multi-material 3D printed objects that is inspired by RenderMan and modern GPU pipelines. The pipeline supports procedural evaluation of geometric detail and material composition, using shader-like fablets, allowing models to be specified easily and efficiently. We describe a streaming archi- tecture for OpenFab; only a small fraction of the final volume is stored in memory and output is fed to the printer with little startup delay. We demonstrate it on a variety of multi-material objects. CR},

For many years, the design and selection of this kind of materials in engineering has been a challenge, because of the difficulties in the nanoscale and micro-scale analysis. Moreover, Identifying mechanism of deformation and failure, do the structural analysis to obtain bulk mechanical properties and analyse the microstructural design of cellular solids are generally obtained from experimental procedures, generating high cost-expensive prototype tests.

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

abstract = {This article describes a new multivariate measure of overall gait pathology called the Gait Deviation Index (GDI). The first step in developing the GDI was to use kinematic data from a large number of walking strides to derive a set of mutually independent joint rotation patterns that efficiently describe gait. These patterns are called gait features. Linear combinations of the first 15 gait features produced a 98{\%} faithful reconstruction of both the data from which they were derived and 1000 validation strides not used in the derivation. The GDI was then defined as a scaled distance between the 15 gait feature scores for a subject and the average of the same 15 gait feature scores for a control group of typically developing (TD) children. Concurrent and face validity data for the GDI are presented through comparisons with the Gillette Gait Index (GGI), Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire Walking Scale (FAQ), and topographic classifications within the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy (CP). The GDI and GGI are strongly correlated (r2= 0.56). The GDI scales with FAQ level, distinguishes levels from one another, and is normally distributed across FAQ levels six to ten and among TD children. The GDI also scales with respect to clinical involvement based on topographic CP classification in Hemiplegia Types I-IV, Diplegia, Triplegia and Quadriplegia. The GDI offers an alternative to the GGI as a comprehensive quantitative gait pathology index, and can be readily computed using the electronic addendum provided with this article. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Laser beam is focussed for melting and vaporizing the unwanted material from the parent material. It is suitable for geometrically complex profile cutting and making miniature holes in sheetmetal. Among various type of lasers used for machining in industries, CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers are most established. In recent years, researchers have explored a number of ways to improve the LBM process performance by analysing the different factors that affect the quality characteristics. The experimental and theoretical studies show that process performance can be improved considerably by proper selection of laser parameters, material parameters and operating parameters. This paper reviews the research work carried out so far in the area of LBM of different materials and shapes. It reports about the experimental and theoretical studies of LBM to improve the process performance. Several modelling and optimization techniques for the determination of optimum laser beam cutting condition have been critically examined. The last part of this paper discusses the LBM developments and outlines the trend for future research. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many gait studies include subjects walking well below or above typical self-selected comfortable (free) speed. For this reason, a descriptive study examining the effect of walking speed on gait was conducted. The purpose of the study was to create a single-source, readily accessible repository of comprehensive gait data for a large group of children walking at a wide variety of speeds. Three-dimensional lower extremity joint kinematics, joint kinetics, surface electromyographic (EMG), and spatio-temporal data were collected on 83 typically developing children (ages 4-17) walking at speeds ranging from very slow ({\textgreater}3 standard deviations below mean free speed) to very fast ({\textgreater}3 standard deviations above mean free speed). The resulting data show that speed has a significant influence on many measures of interest, such as kinematic parameters in the sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes. The same was true for kinetic data (ground reaction force, moment, and power), normalized EMG signals, and spatio-temporal parameters. Examples of parameters with linear and various nonlinear speed dependencies are provided. The data from this study, including an extensive electronic addendum, can be used as a reference for both basic biomechanical and clinical gait studies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Most topology optimization techniques find the optimal layout of a structure under static loads. Some studies are focused on dynamic response topology optimization because dynamic forces act in the real world. Dynamic response topology optimization is solved in the time or frequency domain. A method for dynamic response topology optimization in the time domain is proposed using equivalent static loads. Equivalent static loads are static loads that generate the same displacement field as dynamic loads at each time step. The equivalent static loads are made by multiplying the linear stiffness matrix and the displacement field from dynamic analysis and used as multiple loading conditions for linear static topology optimization. The results of topology optimization are again used in dynamic analysis and a cyclic process is used until the convergence criterion is satisfied. The paradigm of the method was originally developed for size and shape optimizations. A new objective function is defined to minimize the peaks of the compliance in the time domain and a convergence criterion is newly defined considering that there are many design variables in topology optimization. The developed method is verified by solving some examples and the results are discussed.},

Foot ulcers are more likely to be of neuropathic origin, and therefore eminently preventable, in developing countries, which will experience the greatest rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the next 20 years. People at greatest risk of ulceration can easily be identified by careful clinical examination of the feet: education and frequent follow-up is indicated for these patients. When assessing the economic effects of diabetic foot disease, it is important to remember that rates of recurrence of foot ulcers are very high, being greater than 50{\%} after 3 years. Costing should therefore include not only the immediate ulcer episode, but also social services, home care, and subsequent ulcer episodes. A broader view of total resource use should include some estimate of quality of life and the final outcome.

abstract = {Preface Today the finite element method (FEM) is considered as one of the well established and convenient technique for the computer solution of complex problems in different fields of engineering: civil engineering, mechanical engineering, nuclear engineering, biomedical engineering, hydrodynamics, heat conduction, geo-mechanics, etc. From other side, FEM can be examined as a powerful tool for the approximate solution of differential equations describing different physical processes. The success of FEM is based largely on the basic finite element procedures used: the formulation of the problem in variational form, the finite element dicretization of this formulation and the effective solution of the resulting finite element equations. These basic steps are the same whichever problem is considered and together with the use of the digital computer present a quite natural approach to engineering analysis. The objective of this course is to present briefly each of the above aspects of the finite element analysis and thus to provide a basis for the understanding of the complete solution process. According to three basic areas in which knowledge is required, the course is divided into three parts. The first part of the course comprises the formulation of FEM and the numerical procedures used to evaluate the element matrices and the matrices of the complete element assemblage. In the second part, methods for the efficient solution of the finite element equilibrium equations in static and dynamic analyses will be discussed. In the third part of the course, some modelling aspects and general features of some Finite Element Programs (ANSYS, NISA, LS-DYNA) will be briefly examined. To acquaint more closely with the finite element method, some excellent books, like [1-4], can be used.},

abstract = {Ground reaction forces and moments (GRF{\&}M) are important measures used as input in biomechanical analysis to estimate joint kinetics, which often are used to infer information for many musculoskeletal diseases. Their assessment is conventionally achieved using laboratory-based equipment that cannot be applied in daily life monitoring. In this study, we propose a method to predict GRF{\&}M during walking, using exclusively kinematic information from fully-ambulatory inertial motion capture (IMC). From the equations of motion, we derive the total external forces and moments. Then, we solve the indeterminacy problem during double stance using a distribution algorithm based on a smooth transition assumption. The agreement between the IMC-predicted and reference GRF{\&}M was categorized over normal walking speed as excellent for the vertical ($\rho$ = 0.992, rRMSE = 5.3{\%}), anterior ($\rho$ = 0.965, rRMSE = 9.4{\%}) and sagittal ($\rho$ = 0.933, rRMSE = 12.4{\%}) GRF{\&}M components and as strong for the lateral ($\rho$ = 0.862, rRMSE = 13.1{\%}), frontal ($\rho$ = 0.710, rRMSE = 29.6{\%}), and transverse GRF{\&}M ($\rho$ = 0.826, rRMSE = 18.2{\%}). Sensitivity analysis was performed on the effect of the cut-off frequency used in the filtering of the input kinematics, as well as the threshold velocities for the gait event detection algorithm. This study was the first to use only inertial motion capture to estimate 3D GRF{\&}M during gait, providing comparable accuracy with optical motion capture prediction. This approach enables applications that require estimation of the kinetics during walking outside the gait laboratory.},

abstract = {Aim of this study was to provide a non-invasive assessment of the dynamic properties of the ankle joint during human locomotion, with specific focus on the effects of gender and age. Accordingly, flexion-extension angles and moments, obtained through gait analysis, were used to generate moment-angle loops at the ankle joint in 120 healthy subjects walking at a same normalized speed. Four reproducible types of loops were identified: Typical Loops, Narrow, Large and Yielding loops. No significant changes in the slopes of the main loop phases were observed as a function of gender and age, with the exception of a relative increase in the slope of the descending phase in elderly males compared to adult females. As for the ergometric parameters, the peak ankle moment, work produced and net work along the cycle were slightly, but significantly affected, with progressively decrease in the following order: Adult Males, Adult Females, Elderly Males and Elderly Females. The evidence that only few of the quantitative aspects of moment-angle loops were affected suggests that the control strategy which regulates the biomechanical properties of the ankle joint during walking is rather robust and qualitatively consistent across genders and age.},

abstract = {This study aims at understanding the constitutive relation and critical condition for the shock compression of cellular solids. A 2D virtual foam is constructed from the cross-section of a closed-cell aluminium foam imaged by micro X-ray computed tomography, which enables the realistic consideration of meso-scale structural effect in numerical modelling. Quasi-static and shock compressions of the 2D foam are simulated. A series of Hugoniot relations between shock speed (and other mechanical quantities) and impact speed are determined from the finite element (FE) simulations. It is found that the shock speed increases approximately linearly with impact speed, similar to that observed for condensed solids, but the related material constants for cellular solids have different physical implications, whereas the shock strain, stress and energy increase with impact speed nonlinearly, due to shock-enhanced cell compaction and cell-wall plastic deformation. Based on conservation laws in continuum mechanics, other Hugoniot relations are derived from the basic linear one, which agree well with those obtained from the FE simulations. It is thus demonstrated that the unique linear Hugoniot relation can be used to characterise the shock constitutive behaviour which is distinct from the quasi-static one. Furthermore, a new analytical method based on the linear Hugoniot relation is proposed to estimate the critical impact speed for shock initiation, which has reasonable agreement with the present FE simulations and previous experimental and numerical results, and outperforms the existing methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique that allows to untangle high-order/curvilinear meshes. The technique makes use of unconstrained optimization where element Jacobians are constrained to lie in a prescribed range through moving log-barriers. The untangling procedure starts from a possibly invalid curvilinear mesh and moves mesh vertices with the objective of producing elements that all have bounded Jacobians. Bounds on Jacobians are computed using the results of Johnen et al. (2012, 2013) [1,2]. The technique is applicable to any kind of polynomial element, for surface, volume, hybrid or boundary layer meshes. A series of examples demonstrate both the robustness and the efficiency of the technique. The final example, involving a time explicit computation, shows that it is possible to control the stable time step of the computation for curvilinear meshes through an alternative element deformation measure. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Human gait provides a way of locomotion by combined efforts of the brain, nerves, and muscles. Conventionally, the human gait has been considered subjectively through visual observations but now with advanced technology, human gait analysis can be done objec-tively and empirically for the better quality of life. In this paper, the literature of the past survey on gait analysis has been discussed. This is followed by discussion on gait analysis methods. Vision-based human motion analysis has the potential to provide an inexpensive, non-obtrusive solution for the estimation of body poses. Data parameters for gait analy-sis have been discussed followed by preprocessing steps. Then the implemented machine learning techniques have been discussed in detail. The objective of this survey paper is to present a comprehensive analysis of contemporary gait analysis. This paper presents a framework (parameters, techniques, available database, machine learning techniques, etc.) for researchers in identifying the infertile areas of gait analysis. The authors expect that the overview presented in this paper will help advance the research in the field of gait analysis. Introduction to basic taxonomies of human gait is presented. Applications in clinical diag-nosis, geriatric care, sports, biometrics, rehabilitation, and industrial area are summarized separately. Available machine learning techniques are also presented with available datasets for gait analysis. Future prospective in gait analysis are discussed in the end.},

@book{Vaughan1999,
abstract = {This book was created as a companion to the GaitLab software package. Our intent was to introduce gait analysis, not to provide a comprehensive guide. We try to serve readers with diverse experience and areas of interest by discussing the basics of human gait as well as some of the theoretical, biomechanical, and clinical aspects. In chapter 1 we take you in search of the homunculus, the little being inside each of us who makes our walking patterns unique. We represent the walking human as a series of interconnected systems {\'{o}} neural, muscular, skeletal, mechanical, and anthropometric {\'{o}} that form the framework for detailed gait analysis. The three-dimensional and cyclical nature of human gait is described in chapter 2. We also explain how many of the relevant parameters can be expressed as a function of the gait cycle, including kinematics ( e.g ., height of lateral malleolus), kinetics ( e.g ., vertical ground reaction force), and muscle activity ( e.g ., EMG of rectus femoris). In chapter 3 we show you how to use the framework constructed in the first two chapters to integrate anthropometric, 3-D kinematic, and 3-D force plate data. For most readers this will be an important chapter {\'{o}} it is here that we suggest many of the conventions we believe to be lacking in three- dimensional gait analysis. Although conceptually rigorous, the mathemati- cal details are kept to a minimum to make the material accessible to all stu- dents of human motion. (For the purists interested in these details, that infor- mation is in Appendix B.) In chapter 4 we describe the basics of electromyography (EMG) and how it reveals the actions of the various muscle groups. We discuss some of the techniques involved and then illustrate the phasic behaviour of muscles dur- ing the gait cycle and describe how these signals may be statistically analysed. One of the purposes of this book is to help clinicians assess the gaits of their patients. Chapter 5 presents a case study of a 23 year-old-man with cerebral palsy. We have a complete set of 3-D data for him that can be processed and analyzed in GaitLab . Beginning in Appendix A we use illustrated animation sequences to em- phasize the dynamic nature of human gait. By carefully fanning the pages of the appendixes, you can get a feel for the way the human body integrates muscle activity, joint moments, and ground reaction forces to produce a repeatable gait pattern. These sequences bring the walking subject to life and should provide you with new insights. The detailed mathematics used to integrate anthropometry, kinematics, and force plate data and to generate 3-D segment orientations, and 3-D joint forces and moments are presented in Appendix B. This material, which is the basis for the mathematical routines used in GaitLab , has been included for the sake of completeness. It is intended for researchers who may choose to include some of the equations and procedures in their own work. The various pieces of commercially available equipment that may be used in gait analysis are described and compared in Appendix C. This summary has been gleaned from the World Wide Web in late 1998 and you should be aware that the information can date quite rapidly. Dynamics of Human Gait provides a solid foundation for those new to gait analysis, while at the same time addressing advanced mathematical tech- niques used for computer modelling and clinical study. As the first part of Gait Analysis Laboratory , the book should act as a primer for your explora- tion within the GaitLab environment. We trust you will find the material both innovative and informative.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A high degree of gait symmetry is characteristic of healthy gait. The aim of this study is to examine the symmetry of various gait parameters in subjects with unilateral trans-tibial amputation over a range of acceptable anteroposterior translational and tilt alignments, and further to examine if a consistent alignment of highest symmetry can be found. Acceptable alignments were determined by bench, static and dynamic testing on level and non-level surfaces. A total of 15 kinetic and kinematic parameters were then measured in the seven subjects participating in this study. Results indicate that some parameters show consistently higher symmetries, particularly the vertical ground reaction force parameters and the stance duration, step length and time to full knee flexion during the swing phase. Symmetries in other parameters such as knee flexion at loading response, acceleration impulse, and peak anteroposterior propulsive force seem to have little relevance in determining whether the gait pattern for that prosthetic alignment is acceptable or not. While analysis of the symmetry of more relevant gait parameters may assist the prosthetist in consistently and objectively identifying a most symmetrical alignment within the acceptable range, further clinical study is required before any conclusions can be drawn regarding evaluation of symmetry as a tool in defining any optimum alignment.},

Use of a powered ankle–foot prosthesis normalizes step-to-step transition work during level-ground walking over a range of speeds for people with a transtibial amputation, but the effects on joint work during level-ground, uphill, and downhill walking have not been assessed. We investigated how use of passive-elastic and powered ankle–foot prostheses affect leg joint biomechanics during level-ground and sloped walking. 10 people with a unilateral transtibial amputation walked at 1.25 m/s on a dual-belt force-measuring treadmill at 0°, ±3°, ±6°, and ±9° using their own passive-elastic and a powered prosthesis (BiOM T2,) while we measured kinematic and kinetic data. We calculated AL and UL prosthetic, ankle, knee, hip, and individual leg positive, negative, and net work. Use of a powered compared to passive-elastic ankle– foot prosthesis resulted in greater AL prosthetic and individual leg net work on uphill and downhill slopes. Over a stride, AL prosthetic positive work was 23–30{\%} greater (p {\textless} 0.05) during walking on uphill slopes of +6°, and +9°, prosthetic net work was up to 10 times greater (more positive) (p ≤ 0.005) on all uphill and downhill slopes and individual leg net work was 146 and 82{\%} more positive (p {\textless} 0.05) at uphill slopes of +6° and +9°, respectively, with use of the powered compared to passive-elastic prosthesis. Greater prosthetic positive and net work through use of a powered ankle–foot prosthesis during uphill and downhill walking improves mechanical work symmetry between the legs, which could decrease metabolic cost and improve functional mobility in people with a transtibial amputation.},

The brake using MR fluid (we call it MR brake) has a simple structure and can control its braking force with a low voltage. Prosthesis users often tumble because they don't have dorsiflexor, so that we propose putting MR brake taking the place of dorsiflexion. We hope that prosthesis users can walk more naturally and smoothly by use of developed intelligent prosthetic ankle joint with MR brake. We developed a prototype of it and evaluated it with walking experiments before. But there were some problems with the prototype in terms of hardware and experimental environments. Therefore we have developed a 2nd prototype of the intelligent prosthetic ankle joint with the MR brake, which was improved considering previous problems, and then we have carried out the walking experimental evaluation of it},

The present study reports on the results of a series of computational experiments that explore the effect topology and microstructural irregularity (or non-periodicity) on overall mechanical response of cellular solids. Compressive response of various 2D topologies such as honeycombs, stochastic Voronoi foams as well as tetragonal and triangular lattice structures have been investigated as functions of quantitative irregularity parameters. The fundamental issues addressed are (i) uniqueness of mechanical response in irregular microstructures, and effects of (ii) specimen size, (iii) boundary morphology, (iv) cellular topology, and (v) microstructural irregularity on mechanical response.},

abstract = {Although joint biomechanics and whole-body energetics are well documented for human walking, the underlying mechanisms that govern individual muscle-tendon behaviors are not fully understood. Here, we present a computational model of human walking that unifies muscle and joint biomechanics with whole-body metabolism for level-ground walking at self-selected speed. In the model, muscle-tendon units that dorsiflex the ankle, and flex and extend the knee, are assumed to act as linear springs upon neural activation; each muscle-tendon is modeled as a tendon spring in series with an isometric force source. To provide the mechanical power lost in step-to-step gait transitions, a Hill-type soleus muscle is modeled to actively plantar flex the ankle using muscle state and force as reflex feedback signals. Finally, to stabilize the trunk during stance, and to protract and retract each leg throughout the swing phase, two mono-articular Hill-type muscles actuate the model's hip joint. Following a forward dynamics optimization procedure, the walking model is shown to predict muscle and joint biomechanics, as well as whole-body metabolism, supporting the idea that the preponderance of leg muscles operate isometrically, affording the relatively high metabolic walking economy of humans.},

The Manufacture of these devices has been changed in last years because of new technologies like computer aided design and computational simulation, this has made that manufacture process become from craft (and subjective) to a process with clear biomechanics guidelines that supports the clinical specialist's work and enable to require less time and to improve the treatments. In this work, several techniques to generation of plantar pressure relief orthoses topographies has been developed and implemented which were based on geometric criteria and pressure distributions in the plantar region during normal gait. The proposed orthoses by the described methods were assessed by a FEM model implemented to estimate contact pressures between plantar region and any established support surface. In order to analyze the performance of the techniques, experimental data were obtained from a study case and performed comparisons between suggested orthoses and a prescription from specialist. The comparative results show that the orthosis obtained by pressure dynamic maps information provide higher plantar pressure reduction percentages than geometric-based and clinical-prescribed custom orthosis.},

abstract = {Gait analysis is the systematic study of human walking, using the eye and brain of experienced observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body movements, body mechanics and the activity of the muscles. In individuals with conditions affecting their ability to walk, gait analysis may be used to make detailed diagnoses and to plan optimal treatment. Over the past few years, gait analysis has ‘come of age' and in a number of centers it is now used routinely to provide the best possible care for certain groups of patients, most notably those with cerebral palsy. Since the benefits of this approach have been well established, it is to be hoped that its usage will continue to spread, so that many more will benefit from the better treatment decisions which can be made when gait analysis is used. I am happy to believe that the first three editions of this book have contributed to this process, by providing a text which does not require a high level of academic learning to be understood. I have heard from people all over the world that they have found the book useful and this I find very gratifying. The next stage in the evolution of gait analysis will hopefully involve improvements in the ease and speed with which gait data can be collected and interpreted, and decreases in the cost of the equipment and the skill level needed to use it. Significant strides have been made in all these aspects since the third edition of the book was published},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

GaitaBase has been established to provide a web-accessible repository system of gait analysis data to improve the sharing of data across local and international clinical and research community. It is used by several clinical and research groups across the world providing cross-group access permissions to retrieve and analyse the data. The system is useful for bench-marking and quality assurance, clinical consultation, and collaborative research. It has the capacity to increase the population sample size and improve the quality of 'normative' gait data.

In this paper, the past, present and future of 3D printing in the foundry sector are profoundly reviewed. 3D printing has the potential to supplement or partially replace the casting method. Today, some castings can be directly printed by metal powders, for example, titanium alloys, nickel alloys and steel parts. Meanwhile, 3D printing has found an unique position in other casting aspects as well, such as printing the wax pattern, ceramic shell, sand core, sand mould, etc. Most importantly, 3D printing is not just a manufacturing method, it will also revolutionize the design of products, assemblies and parts, such as castings, patterns, cores, moulds and shells in casting production. The solid structure of castings and moulds will be redesigned in future into truss or spatially open and skeleton structures. This kind of revolution is just sprouting, but it will bring unimaginable impact on manufacturing including casting production. Nobody doubts the potential of 3D printing technologies in manufacturing, but they do have limitations and drawbacks.},

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if providing ankle power via a powered prosthetic device (BiOM) normalized STA kinematics and kinetics. Eleven individuals with TTA participated in two STA gait analysis sessions: (1) using an ESR foot, and (2) using the BiOM. Eleven height and weight matched able-bodied controls (CONT) were also assessed. Lower extremity peak kinematic and kinetic values were calculated at a self-selected and controlled cadence (80 steps/min). Increased prosthetic limb peak ankle plantarflexion and push-up power were observed while using the BiOM as compared to ESR. Peak ankle power was not significantly different between BiOM and CONT indicating normalization of ankle power generation. However, peak ankle plantarflexion was significantly lower than CONT. Limb asymmetries including greater prosthetic limb hip flexion and power during stance, and decreased prosthetic limb knee power during stance were observed in the BiOM and ESR conditions. The results suggest that the BiOM successfully increased ankle motion and restored ankle power during STA. These differences did not, however, reduce the use of a hip strategy while ascending stairs. Additional device specific training may be necessary to utilize the full benefits of the device.},

abstract = {The lack of functional ankle musculature in lower limb amputees contributes to the reduced prosthetic ankle push-off, compensations at other joints and more energetically costly gait commonly observed in comparison to non-amputees. A variety of energy storing and return prosthetic feet have been developed to address these issues but have not been shown to sufficiently improve amputee biomechanics and energetic cost, perhaps because the timing and magnitude of energy return is not controlled. The goal of this study was to examine how a prototype microprocessor-controlled prosthetic foot designed to store some of the energy during loading and return it during push-off affects amputee gait. Unilateral transtibial amputees wore the Controlled Energy Storage and Return prosthetic foot (CESR), a conventional foot (CONV), and their previously prescribed foot (PRES) in random order. Three-dimensional gait analysis and net oxygen consumption were collected as participants walked at constant speed. The CESR foot demonstrated increased energy storage during early stance, increased prosthetic foot peak push-off power and work, increased prosthetic limb center of mass (COM) push-off work and decreased intact limb COM collision work compared to CONV and PRES. The biological contribution of the positive COM work for CESR was reduced compared to CONV and PRES. However, the net metabolic cost for CESR did not change compared to CONV and increased compared to PRES, which may partially reflect the greater weight, lack of individualized size and stiffness and relatively less familiarity for CESR and CONV. Controlled energy storage and return enhanced prosthetic push-off, but requires further design modifications to improve amputee walking economy.},

Firstly, a numerical benchmark is proposed considering the similarities of tests in the related literature, every test of the benchmark is well-established and used to compare the numerical and visual performance of the methods. Then, an analysis of the local optimization method Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization is carried out, in order to introduce two modifications: 1) to reduce the computational cost in problems of stiffness maximization, and 2) to minimize the volume of the structures. Finally, a novel technique to reduce the dimension of the problem through a proposal of a structure rep- resentation is introduced. This representation is well suited for mono and multi objective evolutionary algorithms in order to maximize stiffness and minimize volume. All the algorithms take advantages of parallel computing to distribute the computational cost implied in the evaluation of solutions.},

In this study, joint stiffness, joint mechanical work and power were assessed, as they relate to dynamic function of joints during locomotion. Ten young healthy subjects (5 males, 5 females) participated in a treadmill walking (0.8–2.0 m/s) and running (1.8–3.8 m/s) study. When running speed increased, the stiffness of all three joints tended to increase. The ankle joint played a dominant role during the stance phase of running, generating more positive work than the knee (p =.003) and hip (p =.0001). The knee and hip joint were more dominant in walking and running swing phase energy absorption and generation, respectively. When locomotion speeds increased, stance phase ankle positive work, swing phase knee negative work, and hip joint positive work tended to increase. These findings suggest that change of locomotion speed or task results in definitive changes to lower extremity joint level mechanics patterns.},

abstract = {Characterizing the quasi-stiffness and work of lower extremity joints is critical for evaluating human locomotion and designing assistive devices such as prostheses and orthoses intended to emulate the biological behavior of human legs. This work aims to establish statistical models that allow us to predict the ankle quasi-stiffness and net mechanical work for adults walking on level ground. During the stance phase of walking, the ankle joint propels the body through three distinctive phases of nearly constant stiffness known as the quasi-stiffness of each phase. Using a generic equation for the ankle moment obtained through an inverse dynamics analysis, we identify key independent parameters needed to predict ankle quasi-stiffness and propulsive work and also the functional form of each correlation. These parameters include gait speed, ankle excursion, and subject height and weight. Based on the identified form of the correlation and key variables, we applied linear regression on experimental walking data for 216 gait trials across 26 subjects (speeds from 0.75-2.63 m/s) to obtain statistical models of varying complexity. The most general forms of the statistical models include all the key parameters and have an R(2) of 75{\%} to 81{\%} in the prediction of the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and propulsive work. The most specific models include only subject height and weight and could predict the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and work for optimal walking speed with average error of 13{\%} to 30{\%}. We discuss how these models provide a useful framework and foundation for designing subject- and gait-specific prosthetic and exoskeletal devices designed to emulate biological ankle function during level ground walking.},

Ankle joint stiffness is a potential underlying mechanism for the greater rate of injury within these two functionally different groups. An alternative candidate mechanism of injury in HA and LA athletes pertains to the efficacy of the foot as a rigid lever during propulsion. The purpose of this study was to quantify the differences in ankle dynamic joint stiffness, and ankle braking work and ankle propulsive work during stance phase of running. Methods: Ten HA and ten LA athletes performed five barefoot running trials while ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics were recorded. Ankle dynamic joint stiffness was calculated as the slope of the ankle joint moment-ankle joint angle plot during load attenuation. Ankle braking and propulsive work values were calculated for the stance phase. Results: HA athletes had significantly greater ankle dynamic joint stiffness and significantly smaller ankle net and propulsive work than LA athletes. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that HA and LA athletes exhibit unique biomechanical patterns during running. These patterns may be related to lower extremity injury. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The prostheses' loading response under bodyweight for an 80 kg person was then simulated, using both Eigenfrequency and time-dependent analysis.

abstract = {Previously developed user-intent-recognition (UIR) systems have demonstrated promising accuracy for identifying the user's locomotion mode, which is potentially useful for volitional control of powered artificial legs in ambulation. The fundamental question facing us now is whether or not the prosthesis users are safe when the UIR system is directly integrated with the intrinsic controller to operate powered artificial legs. In this preliminary study, we aimed to address this question by investigating the effect of UIR errors on the walking stability of users, wearing a UIR-controlled powered transfemoral (TF) prosthesis. First, a novel control of powered prosthesis was developed, which hierarchically connected our designed UIR system with an intrinsic controller. Three types of errors were purposely added into the UIR output at different gait phase while an able-bodied subject walked on a treadmill with the powered prosthesis. Subjective opinions were obtained to evaluate the effect of applied UIR errors on the user's walking balance. The kinematics and kinetics of the prosthetic knee were quantified while the errors occurred. The preliminary results showed that not all the UIR errors applied caused a subjective feeling of balance instability. The effects of UIR errors on the prosthesis control and user's balance depended on the gait phase when the errors happened and the amount of mechanical work applied to the knee joint caused by the errors. The results of this study could aid the future design of true bionic prostheses that enable lower limb amputees to perform various activities intuitively and safely.},

Problems arise when calculating the muscle-tendon work from increases in mechanical energy, largely in correctly attributing these increases either to energy transfer or to muscle-tendon work. In this study, the kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the centre of mass of the whole human body was measured (using a force platform) simultaneously with calculation of the kinetic and potential energy of the body segments due to their movements relative to the body centre of mass (using cinematography) at different speeds of walking and running. Upper and lower boundaries to the total work were determined by including or excluding possible energy transfers between the segments of each limb, between the limbs and between the centre of mass of the body and the limbs. It appears that the muscle-tendon work of locomotion is most accurately measured when energy transfers are only included between segments of the same limb, but not among the limbs or between the limbs and the centre of mass of the whole body.},

When the predicted walking speed is slow, the characteristics of the apparatus are then modified so that less net-work that is performed during that step (as compared to when the predicted walking speed is fast). This may be implemented using one sensor from which the walking speed can be predicted, and a second sensor from which ankle torque can be determined. A controller receives inputs from those sensors, and controls a motor's torque so that the torque for slow walking speeds is lower than the torque for fast walking speeds. This reduces the work performed by the actuator over a gait cycle and the peak actuator power delivered during the gait cycle. In some embodiments, a series elastic element is connected in series with a motor that can drive the ankle, and at least one sensor is provided with an output from which a deflection of the series elastic element can be determined. A controller determines a desired torque based on the output, and controls the motor's torque based on the determined desired torque.},

abstract = {The greatest population of amputees in developed nations are elderly dysvascular transtibial amputees. Conventional prostheses, e.g. the solid ankle cushioned heel (SACH) foot, create difficulties in walking on inclines. The aim of this study was to analyse the gait characteristics of elderly amputees walking on an incline, through quantitative three-dimensional biomechanical analysis, by comparing them to age-matched controls. Participants walked up and down an inclined (5 degrees) instrumented walkway at a self-selected pace. A Vicon System 370 was used to acquire gait data, including temporo-spatial characteristics, ground reaction forces (GRF), electromyography (EMG), kinematics, and kinetics of the lower limb. Compared to the age-matched controls, the amputees demonstrated reduced speed, knee and hip range of motion, hip moments, vertical GRF, along with increased amplitude and periods of muscle activation. The residual limb also had shorter single support stance phase, small stance phase knee moments, and the smallest moments and powers. These differences demonstrate instability in stance of the residual limb. The sources of this instability include the prosthesis' limited range of ankle motion and ankle power generation, coupled with the residual limb's limited proprioception and tolerance of force. For these amputees to regain a gait pattern equivalent to their able-bodied counterparts on inclined walkways, they must be equipped with a prosthesis that has a full range of ankle motion and active power generation at the ankle. Prosthesis design and rehabilitation training should also improve the proprioception of their residual limb and increase their tolerance of force through the residual limb.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Most prosthetic feet are designed to improve amputee gait by storing and releasing elastic energy during stance. However, how prosthetic foot stiffness influences muscle and foot function is unclear. Identifying these relationships would provide quantitative rationale for prosthetic foot prescription that may lead to improved amputee gait. The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of altered prosthetic foot stiffness on muscle and foot function using forward dynamics simulations of amputee walking. Three 2D muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of unilateral below-knee amputee walking with a range of foot stiffness levels were generated, and muscle and prosthetic foot contributions to body support and propulsion and residual leg swing were quantified. As stiffness decreased, the prosthetic keel provided increased support and braking (negative propulsion) during the first half of stance while the heel contribution to support decreased. During the second half of stance, the keel provided decreased propulsion and increased support. In addition, the keel absorbed less power from the leg, contributing more to swing initiation. Thus, several muscle compensations were necessary. During the first half of stance, the residual leg hamstrings provided decreased support and increased propulsion. During the second half of stance, the intact leg vasti provided increased support and the residual leg rectus femoris transferred increased energy from the leg to the trunk for propulsion. These results highlight the influence prosthetic foot stiffness has on muscle and foot function throughout the gait cycle and may aid in prescribing feet of appropriate stiffness.},

However, even the most advanced, commercial, transtibial prostheses available today only passively adjust the position of the ankle during the swing phase of gait and return a portion of the userpsilas own gravitational input. To greatly improve the quality of life of a transtibial amputee, new technologies and approaches must be used to create a cutting-edge robotic ankle prosthesis which can perform on par with, if not outperform, the equivalent able-bodied human ankle. Initial attempts by us and others have had great success in providing the natural gait power and motion through all ranges of walking speeds. A new design is presented which governs both the coronal and sagittal angles and moments of the ankle joint to potentially provide unprecedented levels of athleticism and agility among transtibial amputees.},

However, too little or too much stiffness is believed to increase the risk of musculoskeletal injury. Purpose. To provide a current update of the lower extremity stiffness literature as it pertains to both performance and injury. Summary. It appears that increased stiffness is beneficial to performance. As well it appears that there may be an optimal amount of stiffness that allows for injury-free performance. There is some evidence that increased stiffness may be related to bony injuries and decreased stiffness may be associated with soft tissue injuries. Further investigations should evaluate the relationship between stiffness and injury prospectively. Initial reports suggest that stiffness can be modified in response to the external environment or verbal cues.Relevance. A greater understanding of the role of stiffness in both performance and injury will provide a stronger foundation for the development of optimal training intervention programs.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes a control architecture and intent recognition approach for the real-time supervisory control of a powered lower limb prosthesis. The approach infers user intent to stand, sit, or walk, by recognizing patterns in prosthesis sensor data in real time, without the need for instrumentation of the sound-side leg. Specifically, the intent recognizer utilizes time-based features extracted from frames of prosthesis signals, which are subsequently reduced to a lower dimensionality (for computational efficiency). These data are initially used to train intent models, which classify the patterns as standing, sitting, or walking. The trained models are subsequently used to infer the user's intent in real time. In addition to describing the generalized control approach, this paper describes the implementation of this approach on a single unilateral transfemoral amputee subject and demonstrates via experiments the effectiveness of the approach. In the real-time supervisory control experiments, the intent recognizer identified all 90 activity-mode transitions, switching the underlying middle-level controllers without any perceivable delay by the user. The intent recognizer also identified six activity-mode transitions, which were not intended by the user. Due to the intentional overlapping functionality of the middle-level controllers, the incorrect classifications neither caused problems in functionality, nor were perceived by the user.},

A body of scientific literature comparing MPKs and NMPKs exists but has yet to be critically appraised. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to examine outcomes associated with the use of these interventions among individuals with transfemoral limb loss. A search of biomedical databases identified 241 publications, of which 27 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed for methodological quality and content. We developed 28 empirical evidence statements (EESs) in 9 outcome categories (metabolic energy expenditure, activity, cognitive demand, gait mechanics, environmental obstacle negotiation, safety, preference and satisfaction, economics, and health and quality of life) based on findings in the literature. The level of evidence supporting these EESs varied due to quantity, quality, and consistency of the results. EESs supported by a moderate level of evidence that noted significant differences between MPKs and NMPKs were derived in five of the nine outcome categories. The results from this review suggest that evidence exists to inform clinical practice and that additional research is needed to confirm existing evidence and better understand outcomes associated with the use of NMPKs and MPKs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies of commercially-available trans-tibial prosthetic components have been unable to provide clear insight into the relationships between prosthetic mechanical properties and user performance (i.e., gait quality and energy expenditure), the understanding of which is key to improving prosthesis design and prescription. Many of these studies have been limited by not characterising the mechanical properties of the tested prostheses and/or only considered level walking at self-selected speeds. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic investigation of the effects of ankle rotational stiffness on trans-tibial amputee gait during various walking conditions reflective of those encountered during daily ambulation.

METHODS: Ankle and knee kinematics, prosthetic limb normal ground reaction forces, and net metabolic cost were measured in five traumatic unilateral trans-tibial amputees during treadmill walking on the level, a 5{\%} incline and a 5{\%} decline whilst using an experimental articulated prosthetic foot with four different rotational stiffness setups and without changes in alignment between conditions.

FINDINGS: Overall, lower dorsiflexion stiffness resulted in greater prosthetic side dorsiflexion motion and sound side knee flexion, reduced normal ground reaction force during the loading phase of prosthetic stance and reduced net metabolic cost.

INTERPRETATION: Few differences were observed with changes in plantarflexion stiffness, most likely due to the foot achieving early foot flat. Low dorsiflexion stiffness generally improved gait performance seemingly due to easier tibial progression during stance. However, observed differences were small, suggesting that a wider range of walking and stiffness conditions would be useful to fully explore these effects in future studies.},

abstract = {I n June 1963, the OECD met with national experts on research and development (R{\&}D) statistics at the Villa Falcioneri in Frascati, Italy. The result was the first official version of the Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys of Research and Development, better known as the Frascati Manual. This publication is the sixth edition. Since the fifth edition was issued in 1994, attention has increasingly been paid to R{\&}D and innovation as key elements in the knowledge-based economy. Reliable and comparable statistics and indicators to monitor this area are of crucial importance. This edition therefore makes an effort to strengthen various methodological recommendations and guidelines, in particular for improving R{\&}D statistics in the services sector and collecting more detailed data on human resources for R{\&}D. Because globalisation is a challenge for R{\&}D surveys, the Manual recommends some changes in classifications in an attempt to address this issue. Today's R{\&}D statistics are the result of the systematic development of surveys based on the Frascati Manual and are now part of the statistical system of the OECD member countries. Although the Manual is basically a technical document, it is a cornerstone of OECD efforts to increase the understanding of the role played by science and technology by analysing national systems of innovation. Furthermore, by providing internationally accepted definitions of R{\&}D and classifications of its component activities, the Manual contributes to intergovernmental discussions on “best},

abstract = {System identification techniques were used to examine the position dependence of active ankle joint mechanics. Subjects were required to maintain tonic contractions in either the tibialis anterior (TA) or triceps surae (TS) muscles while the ankle was stochastically displaced about different mean angular positions. The dynamic relation between ankle position and torque was determined for each mean position/tonic torque combination; a non-linear minimization technique was used to estimate the three parameters (inertial, viscous and elastic) of a second-order, underdamped system. Whereas the inertial parameter remained essentially invariant across all test conditions, the viscous and elastic (K) parameters became larger as the level of tonic activity increased and as the joint was rotated toward the extremes of the range of motion. The relation between K and torque was linear at all ankle angles. The slope of this relation remained constant at all mean positions during plantarflexor contractions; during dorsiflexor contractions the slope increased as the ankle was rotated from maximum plantarflexion to maximum dorsiflexion. These findings are discussed in terms of: (1) the physiological correlates of ankle mean position, (2) the relative significance of passive and active joint mechanics and (3) contrasts in joint behaviour during active dorsiflexor and plantarflexor contractions. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

The method is based on hybrid cellular automaton (HCA), which is an implicit optimization technique that uses local rules to update design variables iteratively until meeting the described optimality conditions. By means of an energy-based homogenization approach, the effective properties of the considered material are calculated in terms of element mutual energies. By this method, no sensitivity information is required to find the optimal topology for the considered design objectives: bulk modulus, shear modulus, and negative Poisson's ratio. The proposed method is validated by a series of numerical examples.},

abstract = {Lower-limb prostheses are rapidly advancing with greater computing power and sensing modalities. This paper is an attempt to begin exploring the trade-off between extrinsic and intrinsic control modalities. In this case, between electromyographic (extrinsic) and several internal sensors that can be used for intrinsic control. We propose a method that will identify the particular features, taken from two trans-femoral amputee and one trans-tibial amputee, during locomotion on varying terrain, that perfectly discriminate between locomotion modes. From this we are able to identify the source of the discriminability from a large-set of features that does not depend on the type of amputation. Also, we comment on the use of this algorithm in selecting the most discriminatory and least encumbering sensor/feature combination for transitions when the ground underneath the foot is unknown for trans-tibial amputees.},

The prosthesis design incorporates two motor-driven ball screw units to drive the knee and ankle joints. A spring in parallel with the ankle motor unit is employed to decrease the power consumption and increase the torque output for a given motor size. The device's sensor package includes a custom load cell to measure the sagittal socket interface moment above the knee joint, a custom sensorized foot to measure the ground reaction force at the heel and ball of the foot, and commercial potentiometers and load cells to measure joint positions and torques. A finite-state based impedance control approach, previously developed by the authors, is used and experimental results on level treadmill walking are presented that demonstrate the potential of the device to restore normal gait. The experimental power consumption of the device projects a walking distance of 5.0 km at a speed of 2.8 km/hr with a lithium polymer battery pack.},

abstract = {Knee contact force (KCF) is one of the most meaningful parameters to evaluate function of the knee joint. However in vivo measurement of KCF is not always straight forward. Inverse dynamics analysis, as one of the most frequently used computational techniques to calculate KCF, has its own limitations. The purpose of this study was to develop a feed forward artificial neural network (FFANN) to predict the medial condyle KCF corresponding to two different gait modifications known as medial thrust and trunk sway. Four patients implanted with unilateral knee sensor-based prostheses were obtained from the literature. The network was trained based on pre-rehabilitation gait patterns and was recruited to predict the medial KCF associated with rehabilitation patterns. Generalization ability of the proposed network was tested within three different levels including intra subject (level 1), inter condition (level 2) and inter subject (level 3). FFANN predictions were validated against in vivo measurements.Results showed subject-specific neural network could predict KCF to a certain high level of accuracy (medial thrust: NRMSE-=10.6{\%}, $\rho$-=0.96; trunk sway: NRMSE-=9.6{\%}, $\rho$-=0.96) based on the ground reaction forces (GRFs) and some independent marker trajectories (level 1) which suggested that not all of the markers are necessary for knee force calculation. Moreover at level 2, a generic FFANN could predict the medial knee force based on electromyography (EMG) signals and GRFs (medial thrust:. NRMSE-=11.2{\%}, $\rho$-=0.96; trunk sway:. NRMSE-=10.5{\%}, $\rho$-=0.95) which released the necessity of motion capture and subject specific scaling of a musculoskeletal model. At level 3, neural network could predict the general pattern and features of KCF for a new subject that was not used in the network training (medial thrust: NRMSE-=12.6{\%}, $\rho$-=0.95; trunk sway: NRMSE-=13.3{\%}, $\rho$-=0.94).In conclusion, FFANN could predict the medial knee joint loading corresponding to two different knee rehabilitations based on pre-rehabilitation gait patterns. Compared to the inverse dynamics method, artificial intelligence represents a much easier and faster method; together they can be combined to calculate joint loading involving fewer markers and speed up the calculations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Over time, leg prostheses have improved in design, but have been incapable of actively adapting to different walking velocities in a manner comparable to a biological limb. People with a leg amputation using such commercially available passive-elastic prostheses require significantly more metabolic energy to walk at the same velocities, prefer to walk slower and have abnormal biomechanics compared with non-amputees. A bionic prosthesis has been developed that emulates the function of a biological ankle during level-ground walking, specifically providing the net positive work required for a range of walking velocities. We compared metabolic energy costs, preferred velocities and biomechanical patterns of seven people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the bionic prosthesis and using their own passive-elastic prosthesis to those of seven non-amputees during level-ground walking. Compared with using a passive-elastic prosthesis, using the bionic prosthesis decreased metabolic cost by 8 per cent, increased trailing prosthetic leg mechanical work by 57 per cent and decreased the leading biological leg mechanical work by 10 per cent, on average, across walking velocities of 0.75–1.75 m s−1 and increased preferred walking velocity by 23 per cent. Using the bionic prosthesis resulted in metabolic energy costs, preferred walking velocities and biomechanical patterns that were not significantly different from people without an amputation.},

Este proyecto involucr{\'{o}} a la Universidad Militar como ente ejecutor, al Hospital Militar como asesor t{\'{e}}cnico y a la Industria Militar como productor del prototipo y gestor del proyecto, cuyos resultados fueron el desarrollo de una rodilla hidr{\'{a}}ulica polic{\'{e}}ntrica y un pie de alta respuesta din{\'{a}}mica. Todo se debe al an{\'{a}}lisis realizado por la Subgerencia T{\'{e}}cnica y Comercial, el cu{\'{a}}l inicia describiendo un panorama nacional de 8.572 v{\'{i}}ctimas (entre civiles y militares) heridas en Colombia por las MAP, y que de acuerdo a las estad{\'{i}}sticas realizadas, el 90{\%} de esas v{\'{i}}ctimas son amputadas de sus miembros inferiores. La DGSM, el HOMIC, DISAN-EJC y la DISAN PONAL muy amablemente suministraron a INDUMIL las estad{\'{i}}sticas sobre los dispositivos prot{\'{e}}sicos implantados a los usuarios de las FF. MM. Para el caso de HOMIC se obtuvieron registros desde 2009 hasta marzo de 2014, encontrando que de los amputados de miembro inferior en el Hospital, el 77{\%} es amputado transtibial (por debajo de rodilla), el 21{\%} es amputado transfemoral (por encima de rodilla) y el 2{\%} tiene alg{\'{u}}n otro tipo de amputaci{\'{o}}n. De los datos anteriores se puede decir que el 21{\%} de los amputados del HOMIC requiere rodilla, teniendo un promedio de consumo de 82 pr{\'{o}}tesis anuales; en cambio, el pie pasa a tener una cobertura del 98{\%} de los amputados, con un promedio anual de 296 pr{\'{o}}tesis de pie.

abstract = {Mattes SJ, Martin PG, Royer TD. Walking symmetry and energy cost in persons with unilateral transtibial amputations: matching prosthetic and intact limb inertial properties. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:561-8. Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis that increasing the mass and moment of inertia of the prosthetic limb of people with unilateral, transtibial amputations to match the mass and moment of inertia of the intact limb improves walking symmetry without increasing energy cost. Design: Gait symmetry and metabolic energy cost of walking for six subjects with unilateral, transtibial amputations were evaluated under three prosthesis loading conditions. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects: Six ambulatory individuals with unilateral, transtibial amputations. Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.34m/sec under three prosthetic limb loading conditions: (1) no added load; (2) loading that produced a match of prosthetic shank and foot mass and moment of inertia with those of the intact limb (100{\%} load); and (3) a load that was half that of the 100{\%} condition (50{\%} load). Main Outcome Measures: Step length, swing time, stance time, and metabolic energy expenditure. Results: As mass and moment of inertia of the prosthetic limb became more closely matched to the intact limb, step length, swing time, and stance time became less symmetrical. Energy cost for the 100{\%} load condition was significantly greater (6{\%} to 7{\%}) than the baseline and 50{\%} conditions. Conclusions: The loading configuration required to produce a match in the moments of inertia of the prosthetic and intact lower legs resulted in greater gait asymmetry and higher energy cost. {\textcopyright} 2000 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation},

abstract = {Collecting large datasets of amputee gait data is notoriously difficult. Additionally, collecting data on less prevalent amputations or on gait activities other than level walking and running on hard surfaces is rarely attempted. However, with the wealth of user-generated content on the Internet, the scope for collecting amputee gait data from alternative sources other than traditional gait labs is intriguing. Here we investigate the potential of YouTube videos to provide gait data on amputee walking. We use an example dataset of trans-femoral amputees level walking at self-selected speeds to collect temporal gait parameters and cal-culate gait asymmetry. We compare our YouTube data with typical literature values, and show that our methodology produces results that are highly comparable to data collected in a traditional manner. The similarity between the results of our novel methodology and litera-ture values lends confidence to our technique. Nevertheless, clear challenges with the col-lection and interpretation of crowd-sourced gait data remain, including long term access to datasets, and a lack of validity and reliability studies in this area.},

abstract = {Fitting distributions consists in finding a mathematical function which represents in a good way a statistical variable. A statistician often is facing with this problem: he has some observations of a quantitative character x1, x2, xn and he wishes to test if those observations, being a sample of an unknown population, belong from a population with a pdf (probability density function) f(x,$\theta$), where $\theta$ is a vector of parameters to estimate with available data. We can identify 4 steps in fitting distributions: 1) Model/function choice: hypothesize families of distributions; 2) Estimate parameters; 3) Evaluate quality of fit; 4) Goodness of fit statistical tests. This paper aims to face fitting distributions dealing shortly with theoretical issues and practical ones using the statistical environment and language R1. R is a language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics flexible and powerful. We are going to use some R statements concerning graphical techniques 2.0), model/function choice 3.0), parameters estimate 4.0), measures of goodness of fit 5.0) and most common goodness of fit tests 6.0).

abstract = {Over time, leg prostheses have improved in design, but have been incapable of actively adapting to different walking velocities in a manner comparable to a biological limb. People with a leg amputation using such commercially available passive-elastic prostheses require significantly more metabolic energy to walk at the same velocities, prefer to walk slower and have abnormal biomechanics compared with non-amputees. A bionic prosthesis has been developed that emulates the function of a biological ankle during level-ground walking, specifically providing the net positive work required for a range of walking velocities. We compared metabolic energy costs, preferred velocities and biomechanical patterns of seven people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the bionic prosthesis and using their own passive-elastic prosthesis to those of seven non-amputees during level-ground walking. Compared with using a passive-elastic prosthesis, using the bionic prosthesis decreased metabolic cost by 8 per cent, increased trailing prosthetic leg mechanical work by 57 per cent and decreased the leading biological leg mechanical work by 10 per cent, on average, across walking velocities of 0.75–1.75 m s−1 and increased preferred walking velocity by 23 per cent. Using the bionic prosthesis resulted in metabolic energy costs, preferred walking velocities and biomechanical patterns that were not significantly different from people without an amputation.},

These asymmetries are due, in part, to the inability of current prosthetic devices to effectively mimic normal ankle function. The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive set of biomechanical data for able-bodied and unilateral transtibial amputee (TTA) ankle-foot systems for level-ground (LG), stair ascent (SA), and stair descent (SD), and to characterize deviations from normal performance associated with prosthesis use. Ankle joint kinematics, kinetics, torque-angle curves, and effective shapes were calculated for twelve able-bodied individuals and twelve individuals with TTA. The data from this study demonstrated the prosthetic limb can more effectively mimic the range of motion and power output of a normal ankle-foot during LG compared to SA and SD. There were larger differences between the prosthetic and able-bodied limbs during SA and SD, most evident in the torque-angle curves and effective shapes. These data can be used by persons designing ankle-foot prostheses and provide comparative data for assessment of future ankle-foot prosthesis designs.},

abstract = {We examine two prevailing, yet surprisingly contradictory, theories of human walking. The six determinants of gait are kinematic features of gait proposed to minimize the energetic cost of locomotion by reducing the vertical displacement of the body center of mass (COM). The inverted pendulum analogy proposes that it is beneficial for the stance leg to behave like a pendulum, prescribing a more circular arc, rather than a horizontal path, for the COM. Recent literature presents evidence against the six determinants theory, and a simple mathematical analysis shows that a flattened COM trajectory in fact increases muscle work and force requirements. A similar analysis shows that the inverted pendulum fares better, but paradoxically predicts no work or force requirements. The paradox may be resolved through the dynamic walking approach, which refers to periodic gaits produced almost entirely by the dynamics of the limbs alone. Demonstrations include passive dynamic walking machines that descend a gentle slope, and active dynamic walking robots that walk on level ground. Dynamic walking takes advantage of the inverted pendulum mechanism, but requires mechanical work to transition from one pendular stance leg to the next. We show how the step-to-step transition is an unavoidable energetic consequence of the inverted pendulum gait, and gives rise to predictions that are experimentally testable on humans and machines. The dynamic walking approach provides a new perspective, focusing on mechanical work rather than the kinematics or forces of gait. It is helpful for explaining human gait features in a constructive rather than interpretive manner.},

abstract = {This work presents a topology optimization approach for lattice structures subjected to thermal and mechanical loads. The focus of this work is the design of injection molds. The proposed approach seeks to minimize the injection mold mass while satisfying constraints on mechanical and thermal performance. The optimal injection molds are characterized by a quasi-periodic distribution of lattice unit cells of variable relative density. The resulting lattice structures are suitable for additive manufacturing. The proposed structural optimization approach uses thermal and mechanical finite element analyses at two length scales: mesoscale and macroscale. At the mesoscale, lattice unit cells are utilized to obtain homogenized thermal and mechanical properties as a function of the lattice relative density. At the macroscale, the lattice unit cells are optimally distributed using the homogenized properties. The proposed design approach is demonstrated through 2D and 3D examples including the optimal design of an injection mold. The optimized injection mold is prototyped using additive manufacturing. The numerical model of the optimized mold shows that, with respect to a traditional solid mold design, a mass reduction of over 30{\%} can be achieved with a small increase in nodal displacement (under 5 microns) and no difference in nodal temperature.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Upper limb amputations cause severe functional disability and lower the patient's self body image, with severe psychological implications. Many parameters are involved in the successful rehabilitation of upper limb amputations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are any parameters that might predict the successful prosthetic rehabilitation of upper limb amputees. METHOD: The records of 45 patients who had undergone an upper limb amputation were traced. The patients were evaluated according to four parameters: (1) Modified upper extremities amputees' questionnaire; (2) Pain level according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS), range from 1 (lowest) up to 10 (highest); (3) Pain type - phantom or pain in the stump; (4) Functional assessment of prosthetic usage. RESULTS: Thirty (71.43{\%}) of the patients reported difficulties with prosthesis usage. Twenty-three patients (54.76{\%}) were satisfied with their prosthesis - 19 had cosmetic prosthesis and four had body-powered prosthesis. CONCLUSION: No significant affect of the amputation level except for trans-wrist amputation with 100{\%} prosthesis use. No significant difference was found between prosthesis type and the correlation to stump problems. The above-elbow amputees, with dominant hand amputation, who used functional prosthesis (body-powered), achieved the best functional outcome and result.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuromusculoskeletal modeling and simulation enable investigation of the neuromusculoskeletal system and its role in human movement dynamics. These methods are progressively introduced into daily clinical practice. However, a major factor limiting this translation is the lack of robust tools for the pre-processing of experimental movement data for their use in neuromusculoskeletal modeling software. RESULTS: This paper presents MOtoNMS (matlab MOtion data elaboration TOolbox for NeuroMusculoSkeletal applications), a toolbox freely available to the community, that aims to fill this lack. MOtoNMS processes experimental data from different motion analysis devices and generates input data for neuromusculoskeletal modeling and simulation software, such as OpenSim and CEINMS (Calibrated EMG-Informed NMS Modelling Toolbox). MOtoNMS implements commonly required processing steps and its generic architecture simplifies the integration of new user-defined processing components. MOtoNMS allows users to setup their laboratory configurations and processing procedures through user-friendly graphical interfaces, without requiring advanced computer skills. Finally, configuration choices can be stored enabling the full reproduction of the processing steps. MOtoNMS is released under GNU General Public License and it is available at the SimTK website and from the GitHub repository. Motion data collected at four institutions demonstrate that, despite differences in laboratory instrumentation and procedures, MOtoNMS succeeds in processing data and producing consistent inputs for OpenSim and CEINMS. CONCLUSIONS: MOtoNMS fills the gap between motion analysis and neuromusculoskeletal modeling and simulation. Its support to several devices, a complete implementation of the pre-processing procedures, its simple extensibility, the available user interfaces, and its free availability can boost the translation of neuromusculoskeletal methods in daily and clinical practice.},

abstract = {Transtibial (TT) amputations, or below-knee amputations, are among the most frequently performed major limb removals. To replace the missing limb, numerous prosthetic devices were developed. A study of the state-of-the-art in TT prostheses shows that none of the commercially available devices are capable of mimicking an able-bodied ankle-foot complex. Still on a research level, some powered prosthetic devices have the potential to improve amputee walking experience, but still need heavy and bulky actuators to provide the necessary power of propulsion. With the AMP-Foot 2.0, the authors propose a new concept for an energy efficient, powered transtibial prosthesis. Its design enables the use of a low power actuator which stores energy in springs during the complete stance phase that can be released at pushoff. Thanks to this, the size and weight of the actuator can be decreased considerably while the ankle still provides the full power necessary for forward propulsion. A prototype of the AMP-Foot 2.0 has been built and experiments with a transfemural amputee were conducted. The captured data is presented and analyzed throughout this article.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd. Musculoskeletal modeling and marker-based motion capture techniques are commonly used to quantify the motions of body segments, and the forces acting on them during human gait. However, when these techniques are applied to analyze the gait of people with lower limb loss, the clinically relevant interaction between the residual limb and prosthesis socket is typically overlooked. It is known that there is considerable motion and loading at the residuum-socket interface, yet traditional gait analysis techniques do not account for these factors due to the inability to place tracking markers on the residual limb inside of the socket. In the present work, we used a global optimization technique and anatomical constraints to estimate the motion and loading at the residuum-socket interface as part of standard gait analysis procedures. We systematically evaluated a range of parameters related to the residuum-socket interface, such as the number of degrees of freedom, and determined the configuration that yields the best compromise between faithfully tracking experimental marker positions while yielding anatomically realistic residuum-socket kinematics and loads that agree with data from the literature. Application of the present model to gait analysis for people with lower limb loss will deepen our understanding of the biomechanics of walking with a prosthesis, which should facilitate the development of enhanced rehabilitation protocols and improved assistive devices.},

abstract = {In this study, the influence of different prosthetic alignments and components on oxygen consumption and the important biomechanical characteristics of the normal gait pattern of leg amputees was investigated. With 15 transtibial and 12 transfemoral amputees, the oxygen consumption during walking on a treadmill was analyzed and biomechanical parameters during walking on even ground at a self-selected speed were defined. The amputation of all patients was caused by trauma. Variations of the prosthetic alignment affect the energy consumption of transfemoral amputees more significantly than that of transtibial amputees. Comparison of different prosthetic feet worn by transtibial amputees did not show significant differences regarding metabolic parameters. Compared with conventional hydraulic knee controls, the oxygen consumption of transfemoral amputees provided with an electronically controlled hydraulic knee joint is reduced. All investigated variations can be clearly characterized by the sagittal moments acting on the joints of the prosthetic limb during gait. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This introductory course on the classical Boundary Element Method also contains advanced topics such as the Dual Reciprocity and the Hybrid Boundary Element Methods. The latter methods are extensions that permit the application of BME to anisotropic materials, as well as multi-field problems and fluid-structure interaction. The class-tested textbook offers a clear and easy-to-understand introduction to the subject, including worked-out examples that describe all the basic features of the method. The first two chapters not only establish the mathematical basis for BEM but also review the basics of continuum mechanics for field problems, perhaps a unique feature for a text on numerical methods. This helps the reader to understand the physical principles of the field problems, to apply the method judiciously, and toe critically evaluate the results.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize and compare dynamic joint stiffness (DJS) of the ankle in the sagittal plane during natural cadence walking in both genders.

DESIGN: Observation, cross-sectional and matched pairs.

PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one males (mean age=27+/-4.2 years) and 18 females (mean age=22.9+/-4.1 years).

SETTING: Laboratory at the University de Tr{\'{a}}s-os-Montes and Alto Douro. The DJS of the ankle was assessed while participants performed barefoot walking at a natural cadence, was measured using a force platform (1000 Hz), and synchronized with a high-speed camera (200 Hz).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DJS of the ankle in males and females was calculated in two sub-phases (the second and the fourth sub-phases) of the stance phase. The Wilcoxon non-parametric matched-pairs test and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test were used to analyse difference of DJS of the ankle within and between the groups with p0.05 regarded as significant.

RESULTS: Male and female participants demonstrated significantly (p{\textless}0.005) less DJS during the second sub-phase. DJS was not significantly (p{\textgreater}0.063) different between females (0.0511 N m/kg/ degrees ) and males (0.0596 N m/kg/ degrees ) during the second sub-phase. DJS was significantly (p{\textless}0.001) higher in males (0.0844 N m/kg/ degrees ) than females (0.0691 N m/kg/ degrees ) during the fourth sub-phase.

CONCLUSIONS: Gender-specific DJS characteristics demonstrated by females in this study may be used in preventative training programs designed to promote a greater ability to use contractile components to produce mechanical energy through the ankle.},

Systematic procedures are presented to construct a bond graph and to analyse it, to generate equations, to generate block diagrams. Furthermore, analysis can be done on graph level, i.e. without the often tedious and error-prone work of generation of differential equations. Note that the essential analysis techniques on graph level and the generation of equations are automated for which several software packages are available (we use 20-SIM) Advice on efficient simulation of bond graph models is presented.

Many complex engineering optimization problems can be modelled as multi-objective formulations. This book provides an introduction to multi-objective optimization using meta-heuristic algorithms, GA and PSO and how they can be applied to problems like hardware/software partitioning in embedded systems, circuit partitioning in VLSI, design of operational amplifiers in analog VLSI, design space exploration in high-level synthesis, delay fault testing in VLSI testing and scheduling in heterogeneous distributed systems. It is shown how, in each case, the various aspects of the EA, namely its representation and operators like crossover, mutation, etc, can be separately formulated to solve these problems. This book is intended for design engineers and researchers in the field of VLSI and embedded system design. The book introduces the multi-objective GA and PSO in a simple and easily understandable way that will appeal to introductory readers.},

At push-off, this energy can be released hereby providing propulsion forces and torques to the amputee.With the use of the so-called catapult actuator, the size and weight of the drive can be decreased compared to state-of-the-art powered prostheses, while still providing the full power necessary for walking. In this article, the authors present a detailed description of the catapult actuator followed by a comparison with existing actuator technology in powered prosthetic feet with regard to torque and power requirements. The implication on the actuator's design will then be outlined. Further, a description of the control strategy behind the AMP-Foot 2 and 2.1 will be given.

abstract = {This paper documents the emergence of virtual testing frameworks for prediction of the constitutive responses of engineering materials. A detailed study is presented, of the philosophy underpinning virtual testing schemes: highlighting the structure, challenges and opportunities posed by a virtual testing strategy compared with traditional laboratory experiments. The virtual testing process has been discussed from atomistic to macrostructural length scales of analyses. Several implementations of virtual testing frameworks for diverse categories of materials are also presented, with particular emphasis on composites, cellular materials and biomaterials (collectively described as heterogeneous systems, in this context). The robustness of virtual frameworks for prediction of the constitutive behaviour of these materials is discussed. The paper also considers the current thinking on developing virtual laboratories in relation to availability of computational resources as well as the development of multi-scale material model algorithms. In conclusion, the paper highlights the challenges facing developments of future virtual testing frameworks. This review represents a comprehensive documentation of the state of knowledge on virtual testing from microscale to macroscale length scales for heterogeneous materials across constitutive responses from elastic to damage regimes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Design: Estimates were constructed using age-, sex-, and race-specific incidence rates for amputation combined with age-, sex-, and race-specific assumptions about mortality. In- cidence rates were derived from the 1988 to 1999 Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, corrected for the likelihood of reamputation among those undergoing amputation for vascular disease. Incidence rates were assumed to remain constant over time and applied to historic mortality and population data along with the best available estimates of relative risk, future mortality, and future population projections. To investigate the sensitivity of our projections to increasing or decreasing incidence, we devel- oped alternative sets of estimates of limb loss related to dys- vascular conditions based on assumptions of a 10{\%} or 25{\%} increase or decrease in incidence of amputations for these conditions.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in non-surgical gait rehabilitation treatments to reduce the loading in the knee joint. In particular, synergetic kinematic changes required for joint offloading should be determined individually for each subject. Previous studies for gait rehabilitation designs are typically relied on a "trial-and-error" approach, using multi-body dynamic (MBD) analysis. However MBD is fairly time demanding which prevents it to be used iteratively for each subject.This study employed an artificial neural network to develop a cost-effective computational framework for designing gait rehabilitation patterns. A feed forward artificial neural network (FFANN) was trained based on a number of experimental gait trials obtained from literature. The trained network was then hired to calculate the appropriate kinematic waveforms (output) needed to achieve desired knee joint loading patterns (input). An auxiliary neural network was also developed to update the ground reaction force and moment profiles with respect to the predicted kinematic waveforms. The feasibility and efficiency of the predicted kinematic patterns were then evaluated through MBD analysis.Resuls showed that FFANN-based predicted kinematics could effectively decrease the total knee joint reaction forces. Peak values of the resultant knee joint forces, with respect to the bodyweight (BW), were reduced by 20{\%} BW and 25{\%} BW in the midstance and the terminal stance phases. Impulse values of the knee joint loading patterns were also decreased by 17{\%} BW*s and 24{\%}BW*s in the corresponding phases. The FFANN-based framework suggested a cost-effective forward solution which directly calculated the kinematic variations needed to implement a given desired knee joint loading pattern. It is therefore expected that this approach provides potential advantages and further insights into knee rehabilitation designs.},

@book{Horvath2015,
abstract = {3D printers have been around for about 30 years, but you would never know that from the current explosion in both 3D printers and the uses for them. Although some of the more extreme hype in the field will go away in due course, 3D printing really does enable some new ways of thinking about creating products, particularly custom ones. What is new is the availability of low-cost 3D printers (costing from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars). Tese lower-cost machines have the promise of making the front of the product-development process much more efficient and enabling distributed manufacturing. Tis book focuses on these consumer-level printers and their applications. In particular, the emphasis is on open source 3D printers—machines whose software and hardware designs are freely shared online. 3D printing can be defined pretty simply: creating an object by building it up layer by layer, rather than machining it away, the way you would by making something from a block of wood, or squirting something into a mold, as you would for injection-molded plastic parts. Its flexibility and the sheer magic of seeing something built from nothing have captured people's imaginations, and it is clear that surprising applications will continue to pop up for years to come. Tis book is intended for several audiences. First, it is meant to be a self-contained tutorial on consumer 3D printers and the open source software that runs them. Te field is changing very rapidly, though, and as such you should expect that the details of the software and hardware will shift away from the book's descriptions. A recurring metaphor you will see in this book is that 3D printing is about as complex as cooking. In cooking terms, you will find that this book has a bias that shies away from providing recipes to follow exactly and instead leans toward teaching you how to cook over the long haul. Tis book also is intended to be used as a text for a semester-length class or university extension certificate series covering 3D printing, its applications, and its place in manufacturing innovation. It might be paired with an in-depth class on 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software for students interested in engineering and industrial or product design applications. Similarly, it might be paired with in-depth instruction in one of the sculptural 3D-modeling programs for students developing skills in 3D animation or fine art. Part 1 (Chapters 1–3) of the book gives background on the history of these printers, talks about how the hardware works, and gives some insight into the open source and do-it-yourself movements that nurtured the propagation of the consumer 3D-printer industry. Part 2 (Chapters 4–8) is the nitty-gritty tutorial on the workflow of using a 3D printer: developing a 3D model, slicing it into layers that the printer will create one at a time, and controlling the printer in real time. Part 2 also reviews available materials and walks through some case studies. Part 3 reviews how you can take your 3D print and post-process it to improve the surface finish, create larger projects, or even cast a metal part from your printed one. Part 3 covers troubleshooting, too, just in case you got a little too ambitious for your printer's linking . Finally, in Part 4 you will read about how educators, scientists, and others are using 3D printers, and where the field may go in the future. If you are just starting your exploration of the field, welcome. Hopefully, this book will be a good guide for you, and you will finish it ready to take on challenges and try to help build this new frontier along with us. xxiii},

abstract = {We present a powered knee prosthesis with two series-elastic actuators positioned in parallel in an agonist-antagonist arrangement. To motivate the knee's design, we developed a prosthetic knee model that comprises a variable damper and two series-elastic clutch units that span the knee joint. Using human gait data to constrain the model's joint to move biologically, we varied model parameters using an optimization scheme that minimized the sum over time of the squared difference between the model's joint torque and biological knee values. We then used these optimized values to specify the mechanical and control design of the prosthesis for level-ground walking. We hypothesized that a variable-impedance control design could produce humanlike knee mechanics during steady-state level-ground walking. As a preliminary evaluation of this hypothesis, we compared the prosthetic knee mechanics of an amputee walking at a self-selected gait speed with those of a weight- and height-matched nonamputee. We found qualitative agreement between prosthetic and human knee mechanics. Because the knee's motors never perform positive work on the knee joint throughout the level-ground gait cycle, the knee's electrical power requirement is modest in walking (8 W), decreasing the size of the onboard battery required to power the prosthesis.},

abstract = {Multibody software designed for mechanical engineering has been successfully employed in biomedical research for many years. For real time operation some biomedical researchers have also adapted game physics engines. However, these tools were built for other purposes and do not fully address the needs of biomedical researchers using them to analyze the dynamics of biological structures and make clinically meaningful recommendations. We are addressing this problem through the development of an open source, extensible, high performance toolkit including a multibody mechanics library aimed at the needs of biomedical researchers. The resulting code, Simbody, supports research in a variety of fields including neuromuscular, prosthetic, and biomolecular simulation, and related research such as biologically-inspired design and control of humanoid robots and avatars. Simbody is the dynamics engine behind OpenSim, a widely used biomechanics simulation application. This article reviews issues that arise uniquely in biomedical research, and reports on the architecture, theory, and computational methods Simbody uses to address them. By addressing these needs explicitly Simbody provides a better match to the needs of researchers than can be obtained by adaptation of mechanical engineering or gaming codes. Simbody is a community resource, free for any purpose.

The fit- ness assignment method is then modified to allow direct intervention of an external deci- sion maker (DM). Finally, the MOGA is gen- eralised further: the genetic algorithm is seen as the optimizing element of a multiobjective optimization loop, which also comprises the DM. It is the interaction between the two that leads to the determination of a satis- factory solution to the problem. Illustrative results of how the DM can interact with the genetic algorithm are presented. They also show the ability of the MOGA to uniformly sample regions of the trade-off surface. 1},

abstract = {Currently available implants for direct attachment of prosthesis to the skeletal system after transfemoral amputation (OPRA system, Integrum AB, Sweden and ISP Endo/Exo prosthesis, ESKA Implants AG, Germany) show many advantages over the conventional socket fixation. However, restraining biomechanical issues such as considerable bone loss around the stem and peri-prosthetic bone fractures are present. To overcome these limiting issues a new concept of the direct intramedullary fixation was developed. We hypothesize that the new design will reduce the peri-prosthetic bone failure risk and adverse bone remodeling by restoring the natural load transfer in the femur. Generic CT-based finite element models of an intact femur and amputated bones implanted with 3 analyzed implants were created and loaded with a normal walking and a forward fall load. The strain adaptive bone remodeling theory was used to predict long-term bone changes around the implants and the periprosthetic bone failure risk was evaluated by the von Mises stress criterion. The results show that the new design provides close to physiological distribution of stresses in the bone and lower bone failure risk for the normal walking as compared to the OPRA and the ISP implants. The bone remodeling simulations did not reveal any overall bone loss around the new design, as opposed to the OPRA and the ISP implants, which induce considerable bone loss in the distal end of the femur. This positive outcome shows that the presented concept has a potential to considerably improve safety of the rehabilitation with the direct fixation implants.},

abstract = {The subject of this thesis is the application of the dynamic walking approach to human gait. This work is motivated by the needs of persons with disabilities and by a desire to expand basic understanding of human walking. We address human gait from the perspective of dynamic walking, a theoretical approach to legged locomotion which emphasizes the use of simple dynamical models and focuses on behavior over the course of many steps rather than within a single step. We build on results from prior dynamic walking research and develop new areas of exploration, with energetics and stability providing context. We focus on three areas: improvement of prosthetic foot design, the function of arm swinging, and evaluation of balance among the elderly. These issues are addressed by use of dynamic walking models and controlled human subject experiments. We propose a Controlled Energy Storage and Return (CESR) foot prosthesis to increase push-off work and reduce energy expenditure in amputees, and tested a prototype experimentally. To better understand the role of arms swinging in gait, we developed a simple dynamic walking model with free-swinging arms and performed human subject experiments in which subjects swung their arms in various ways. Finally, we studied the effects of aging on balance during walking using a computational model and a human subject experiment in which younger and older adults walked overground for hundreds of consecutive steps. These models and experiments each expand our understanding of the fundamentals of gait and indicate pathways toward assisting individuals with disabilities. Taken as a whole, this work emphasizes the utility of the dynamic walking approach.},

abstract = {Proper selection of prosthetic foot-ankle components with appropriate design characteristics is critical for successful amputee rehabilitation. Elastic energy storage and return (ESAR) feet have been developed in an effort to improve amputee gait. However, the clinical efficacy of ESAR feet has been inconsistent, which could be due to inappropriate stiffness levels prescribed for a given amputee. Although a number of studies have analyzed the effect of ESAR feet on gait performance, the relationships between the stiffness characteristics and gait performance are not well understood. A challenge to understanding these relationships is the inability of current manufacturing techniques to easily generate feet with varying stiffness levels. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid prototyping framework using selective laser sintering (SLS) for the creation of prosthetic feet that can be used as a means to quantify the influence of varying foot stiffness on transtibial amputee walking. The framework successfully duplicated the stiffness characteristics of a commercial carbon fiber ESAR foot. The feet were mechanically tested and an experimental case study was performed to verify that the locomotor characteristics of the amputee's gait were the same when walking with the carbon fiber ESAR and SLS designs. Three-dimensional ground reaction force, kinematic, and kinetic quantities were measured while the subject walked at 1.2 m/s. The SLS foot was able to replicate the mechanical loading response and locomotor patterns of the ESAR foot within +/-2 standard deviations. This validated the current framework as a means to fabricate SLS-based ESAR prosthetic feet. Future work will be directed at creating feet with a range of stiffness levels to investigate appropriate prescription criteria.},

This study investigates whether the analysis of CRP variability leads to additional information about possible differences or similarities between healthy and injured runners. Further, a decision about future applications of CRP variability should be based on the ability to implement and interpret data. 18 healthy female runners (CO) and 18 female runners who suffered from iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) were evaluated by calculating CRP variability for 4 coupling pairs. Besides analyzing continuous variability of CRP, we also averaged it for the whole stance phase and for four predefined stance phase intervals. Confidence intervals were displayed and independent t-tests for comparing the two groups were conducted. During initial and terminal stance phase as well as after heel-off an increase in CRP variability was detected for both groups of runners. In contrast, the foot flat period was characterized by stable joint coordination and a decrease in variability. This paper presents possible interpretations of CRP variability but no statistically significant differences in CRP variability were found between the two groups of runners. Despite the missing statistical significance, a relationship between high CRP variability and injury seems to be conceivable, since the injured runners demonstrated an increased variability for all couplings in the first half of the stance phase. Further application of CRP variability in biomechanical research is essential to determine whether a relationship exists between injury and coordination variability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the overall kinetics and the kinetics at the joints of the lower limb while sprinting at maximum speed, and to compare the data of a double transtibial amputee and able-bodied controls running at the same level of performance. One double transtibial amputee, using dedicated sprinting prostheses, and five able-bodied sprinters participated in the study. The athletes performed submaximal and maximal sprints (60 m) on an indoor track. All of the participants ran three times at each speed (maximal and submaximal). The athletes' kinematics were recorded using the Vicon 624 system with 12 cameras operating at 250 Hz. Four Kistler force plates (1250 Hz) were used to record ground reaction forces (GRF). External joint moments, joint work, and joint power were calculated from the GRF and the kinematic data. The analysis of total body kinetics revealed lower mechanical work during the stance phase for the double transtibial amputee using Cheetah prostheses than for the able-bodied athletes running at the same speed. The joint kinetics showed lower external joint moments and joint power at the hip and the knee joints and higher values of joint power at the (prosthetic) ankle joint of the amputee than for the able-bodied athletes. The ratio of the mechanical work at the ankle joint in the negative and the positive phase during stance was 0.907 for the carbon keels of the prostheses and 0.401 for the healthy ankle joints of the controls. The mechanical work at the knee joints was 11 times higher in the negative phase and 8.1 times higher in the positive phase during stance in the ablebodied athletes than in the double transtibial amputee sprinter. It was assumed that due to reduced work at the joints of the lower limbs and less energy loss in the prosthetic leg, running with the dedicated prostheses allows for maximum sprinting at lower metabolic costs than in the healthy ankle joint complex.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Prosthetic suspension system is an important component of lower limb prostheses. Suspension efficiency can be best evaluated during one of the vital activities of daily living, i.e. walking. A new magnetic prosthetic suspension system has been developed, but its effects on gait biomechanics have not been studied. This study aimed to explore the effect of suspension type on kinetic and kinematic gait parameters during level walking with the new suspension system as well as two other commonly used systems (the Seal-In and pin/lock). Thirteen persons with transtibial amputation participated in this study. A Vicon motion system (six cameras, two force platforms) was utilized to obtain gait kinetic and kinematic variables, as well as pistoning within the prosthetic socket. The gait deviation index was also calculated based on the kinematic data. The findings indicated significant difference in the pistoning values among the three suspension systems. The Seal-In system resulted in the least pistoning compared with the other two systems. Several kinetic and kinematic variables were also affected by the suspension type. The ground reaction force data showed that lower load was applied to the limb joints with the magnetic suspension system compared with the pin/lock suspension. The gait deviation index showed significant deviation from the normal with all the systems, but the systems did not differ significantly. Main significant effects of the suspension type were seen in the GRF (vertical and fore-aft), knee and ankle angles. The new magnetic suspension system showed comparable effects in the remaining kinetic and kinematic gait parameters to the other studied systems. This study may have implications on the selection of suspension systems for transtibial prostheses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT2013061813706N1.},

abstract = {In an effort to improve amputee gait, energy storage and return (ESAR) prosthetic feet have been developed to provide enhanced function by storing and returning mechanical energy through elastic structures. However, the effect of ESAR feet on muscle activity in amputee walking is not well understood. Previous studies have analyzed commercial prosthetic feet with a wide range of material properties and geometries, making it difficult to associate specific ESAR properties with changes in muscle activity. In contrast, prosthetic ankles offer a systematic way to manipulate ESAR properties while keeping the prosthetic heel and keel geometry intact. In the present study, ESAR ankles were added to a Seattle Lightfoot2 to carefully control the energy storage and return by altering the ankle stiffness and orientation in order to identify its effect on lower extremity muscle activity during below-knee amputee walking. A total of five foot conditions were analyzed: solid ankle (SA), stiff forward-facing ankle (FA), compliant FA, stiff reverse-facing ankle (RA) and compliant RA. The ESAR ankles decreased the activity of muscles that contribute to body forward propulsion and increased the activity of muscles that provide body support. The compliant ankles generally caused a greater change in muscle activity than the stiff ankles, but without a corresponding increase in energy return. Ankle orientation also had an effect, with RA generally causing a lower change in muscle activity than FA. These results highlight the influence of ESAR stiffness on muscle activity and the importance of prescribing appropriate prosthetic foot stiffness to improve rehabilitation outcomes.},

abstract = {Walking is a motor task requiring coordination of many muscles. Previous biomechanical studies, based primarily on analyses of the net ankle moment during stance, have concluded different functional roles for the plantar flexors. We hypothesize that some of the disparities in interpretation arise because of the effects of the uniarticular and biarticular muscles that comprise the plantar flexor group have not been separated. Furthermore, we believe that an accurate determination of muscle function requires quantification of the contributions of individual plantar flexor muscles to the energetics of individual body segments. In this study, we examined the individual contributions of the ankle plantar flexors (gastrocnemius (GAS); soleus (SOL)) to the body segment energetics using a musculoskeletal model and optimization framework to generate a forward dynamics simulation of normal walking at 1.5 m/s. At any instant in the gait cycle, the contribution of a muscle to support and forward progression was defined by its contribution to trunk vertical and horizontal acceleration, respectively, and its contribution to swing initiation by the mechanical energy it delivers to the leg in pre-swing (i.e., double-leg stance prior to toe-off). GAS and SOL were both found to provide trunk support during single-leg stance and pre-swing. In early single-leg stance, undergoing eccentric and isometric activity, they accelerate the trunk vertically but decelerate forward trunk progression. In mid single-leg stance, while isometric, GAS delivers energy to the leg while SOL decelerates it, and SOL delivers energy to the trunk while GAS decelerates it. In late single-leg stance through pre-swing, though GAS and SOL both undergo concentric activity and accelerate the trunk forward while decelerating the downward motion of the trunk (i.e., providing forward progression and support), they execute different energetic functions. The energy produced from SOL accelerates the trunk forward, whereas GAS delivers almost all its energy to accelerate the leg to initiate swing. Although GAS and SOL maintain or accelerate forward motion in mid single-leg stance through pre-swing, other muscles acting at the beginning of stance contribute comparably to forward progression. In summary, throughout single-leg stance both SOL and GAS provide vertical support, in mid single-leg stance SOL and GAS have opposite energetic effects on the leg and trunk to ensure support and forward progression of both the leg and trunk, and in pre-swing only GAS contributes to swing initiation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the energy efficiency of locomotion and free-living physical activity energy expenditure of transfemoral amputees using a mechanical and microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee.

DESIGN: Repeated-measures design to evaluate comparative functional outcomes.

SETTING: Exercise physiology laboratory and community free-living environment.

PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=15; 12 men, 3 women; age, 42+/-9 y; range, 26-57 y) with transfemoral amputation.

INTERVENTION: Research participants were long-term users of a mechanical prosthesis (20+/-10 y as an amputee; range, 3-36 y). They were fitted with a microprocessor-controlled knee prosthesis and allowed to acclimate (mean time, 18+/-8 wk) before being retested.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Objective measurements of energy efficiency and total daily energy expenditure were obtained. The Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire was used to gather subjective feedback from the participants.

RESULTS: Subjects demonstrated significantly increased physical activity-related energy expenditure levels in the participant's free-living environment (P=.04) after wearing the microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee joint. There was no significant difference in the energy efficiency of walking (P=.34). When using the microprocessor-controlled knee, the subjects expressed increased satisfaction in their daily lives (P=.02).

CONCLUSIONS: People ambulating with a microprocessor-controlled knee significantly increased their physical activity during daily life, outside the laboratory setting, and expressed an increased quality of life.},

In the second design, the active length of superelastic hinge is adjusted in order to control the bending stiffness of the element. By adjusting the stiffness, variable level of compliance is achieved at the ankle. In both concepts, during powered plantarflexion in the stance phase of the gait, energy is stored in the shape memory alloy element.

Experimentation was designed to focus specifically on the effect of specimen mesostructure on monotonic tensile behavior and tensile-fatigue life. Analyzed mesostructures include unidirectional laminae with parallel fiber orientations ranging from $\theta$ = 0° (aligned with the loading axis) to $\theta$ = 90° (perpendicular to the loading axis), and alternating laminae with a layering pattern of $\theta$°/($\theta$-90°) fiber orientations. The unidirectional 0° specimens achieved the greatest tensile strength and effective elastic modulus, while the alternating +45°/-45° specimens displayed the best fatigue performance of the specimens tested. Results highlight the anisotropic behavior of FDM components and suggest that the tensile behavior is improved by aligning the fibers of unidirectional laminae more closely with the axis of the applied stress. In addition, the specimens with $\theta$°/($\theta$-90°) fiber orientations displayed incrementally improved tensile properties and fatigue performance from an apparent offsetting effect that results from alternating laminae. The fracture surfaces of the specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy in order to gain further insights into the fatigue damage and failure mechanisms.},

Kinematics and kinetics of the lower limbs were compared during stair ascent and descent performed by patients with the prosthetic foot set to a neutral ankle angle and with an adapted dorsiflexion ankle angle of 4??. Norm distance as well as minimum and maximal values of sagittal kinematics and kinetics were calculated for comparisons between patients and control subjects. For both stair ascent and descent, an improvement of the knee kinematics and kinetics could particularly be noticed on the involved side with an increase of the knee flexion and an increase of the knee moment during stance. Therefore, despite its additional weight compared to a conventional prosthetic ankle, the Proprio-Foot??? should be beneficial to active TT amputees whose knee musculature strength does not constitute a handicap. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The aim of this project was to explore the nature of gait accommodations by unilateral below-knee amputees during walking. Lower extremity kinematic and kinetic data for two groups of subjects, 6 below-knee amputees (both prosthetic and intact limbs) and 6 able-bodied individuals (a single limb), were computed as subjects walked at 1.2 and 1.6 m/s. Kinematic profiles were similar for all three limb conditions. The largest difference between limbs occurred late in stance at the ankle joint when the prosthetic limb displayed substantially less planter flexion because of its passive response to unloading. Joint kinetic differences between limbs were most apparent at the knee. Whereas the net ankle and hip moments were similar for all three limb conditions, the net knee moment for the prosthetic leg deviated from the amputee intact and non-amputee limbs by remaining flexor throughout the stance phase. This response was attributed to an effort to reduce loading on and about the knee joint and stump of the prosthetic limb. Despite the absence of an extensor contribution from the prosthetic knee, the overall support moment on the prosthetic side was sufficient to provide a normal support function.},

abstract = {—Large-scale human motion databases are key for re-search questions ranging from human motion analysis and synthe-sis, biomechanics of human motion, data-driven learning of motion primitives, and rehabilitation robotics to the design of humanoid robots and wearable robots such as exoskeletons. In this paper we present a large-scale database of whole-body human motion with methods and tools, which allows a unifying representation of cap-tured human motion, and efficient search in the database, as well as the transfer of subject-specific motions to robots with differ-ent embodiments. To this end, captured subject-specific motion is normalized regarding the subject's height and weight by using a reference kinematics and dynamics model of the human body, the master motor map (MMM). In contrast with previous approaches and human motion databases, the motion data in our database con-sider not only the motions of the human subject but the position and motion of objects with which the subject is interacting as well. In addition to the description of the MMM reference model, we present procedures and techniques for the systematic recording, labeling, and organization of human motion capture data, object motions as well as the subject–object relations. To allow efficient search for certain motion types in the database, motion recordings are manually annotated with motion description tags organized in a tree structure. We demonstrate the transfer of human motion to humanoid robots and provide several examples of motion analysis using the database.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify which biomechanical and physiological parameters are the most relevant, commonly used, able to discriminate and/or have specific clinical relevance for the gait analysis of lower-limb amputees (LLA).

METHODS: We performed an electronic search via the PubMed, EMBASE and ISI Web of Knowledge databases from 1979 to May 2009. Two independent reviewers assessed the title and abstract of each identified study. The quality assessment of the full text was undertaken using a 13-item checklist divided into three levels: A, B, and C.

RESULTS: The literature search identified 584 abstracts to be considered. After applying the inclusion criteria, we reviewed the full text of a total of 89 articles. The mean article quality was 8±2. No A-level article was found; the primary reason was a negative score in blinded outcome assessment. Sixty-six articles (74{\%}) corresponded to a B-level, and two articles (2{\%}) corresponded to a C-level. Twenty-one articles (24{\%}) did not acquire enough points to be assigned to any level. In this study, we present and discuss the most commonly used and most relevant 32 parameters. Many of the parameters found were not reported in enough studies or in enough detail to allow a useful evaluation.

CONCLUSION: This systematic review can help researchers compare, choose and develop the most appropriate gait evaluation protocol for their field of study, based on the articles with best scores on the criteria list and the relevance of specific biomechanical and physiological parameters.},

abstract = {The paper presents a concept and implementation of a novel hybrid approach to the modelling, solving and optimization of the constrained decision problems. Two environments, mathematical programming (MP) and constraint programming (CP), in which constraints are treated in different ways and different methods are implemented, were combined to use the strengths of both. This integration and hybridization, complemented with an adequate transformation of the problem, facilitates a significant reduction of the combinatorial problem. The whole process takes place at the implementation layer, which makes it possible to use the structure of the problem being solved, implementation environments and the very data. The superiority of the proposed approach over the classical scheme is proved by 1/considerably shorter search time and 2/example-illustrated wide-ranging possibility of expanding the decision and/or optimization models through the introduction of new logical constraints, frequently encountered in practice. The proposed approach is particularly important for the decision models with an objective function and many discrete decision variables added up in multiple constraints. To validate the proposed approach, two illustrative examples are presented and solved. The first example is the authors' original model of cost optimization in the supply chain with multimodal transportation. The second one is the two-echelon variant of the well-known Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, 2E-CVRP. Distance, this metric is more realistic for the considered problem.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal case series.

SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation facility.

PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of 19 unilateral persons with LLA (14 men, mean age, 53.4+/-14.6y).

INTERVENTION: Interdisciplinary rehabilitation.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Generic and specific QOL measures and perception of body image at T1, T2, and T3.

RESULTS: Subjective QOL was relatively high at T1, T2, and T3 (0.87/2, 1.1/2, and 1.0/2, respectively) except for items related to physical functioning. There was no significant change over time for all but 1 QOL satisfaction measure (ability to go outside, P=.024). Prosthesis-related QOL was high at discharge and follow-up. Body-image disturbances were absent over the study period. QOL satisfaction and prosthesis satisfaction were strongly related to lower-limb pain and psychosocial factors (eg, body image).

CONCLUSIONS: QOL of persons with LLA was high and remained relatively stable during inpatient rehabilitation and 3 months after discharge.},

Experiments alone provide important but limited understanding of movement dynamics. Although we can measure some quantities, such as muscle activities and ground reaction forces, responsible for a movement, simulations complement these measurements with estimates of other important variables, such as muscle and joint forces. Simulations also allow us to establish cause-and-effect relationships giving insights into muscle function. Perhaps the most exciting feature of simulations is the potential to perform "what if" studies to test hypotheses, predict functional outcomes, and identify emergent behaviors.

abstract = {Individuals with unilateral transtibial amputations have greater prevalence of osteoarthritis in the intact knee joint relative to the residual leg and non-amputees, but the cause of this greater prevalence is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare knee joint contact forces and the muscles contributing to these forces between amputees and non-amputees during walking using forward dynamics simulations. We predicted that the intact knee contact forces would be higher than those of the residual leg and non-amputees. In the axial and mediolateral directions, the intact and non-amputee legs had greater peak tibio-femoral contact forces and impulses relative to the residual leg. The peak axial contact force was greater in the intact leg relative to the non-amputee leg, but the stance phase impulse was greater in the non-amputee leg. The vasti and hamstrings muscles in early stance and gastrocnemius in late stance were the largest contributors to the joint contact forces in the non-amputee and intact legs. Through dynamic coupling, the soleus and gluteus medius also had large contributions, even though they do not span the knee joint. In the residual leg, the prosthesis had large contributions to the joint forces, similar to the soleus in the intact and non-amputee legs. These results identify the muscles that contribute to knee joint contact forces during transtibial amputee walking and suggest that the peak knee contact forces may be more important than the knee contact impulses in explaining the high prevalence of intact leg osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {While humanoid feet are made of rigid plates, human feet have evolved into highly articulated and flexible elements. This adaptiveness provides key advantages. It absorbs impacts and secures grip when interacting with the environment. However, the human foot design potentially increases the energetic cost, because it features actuators and provides less power transfer than a rigid plate does. Here we use neuromuscular models with different foot designs and show that human feet incur about 20{\%} more energetic cost than rigid ones for walking speeds up to 1.2ms-1, which is close to the preferred walking speed. Above this speed, human feet do not show an energetic disadvantage. In addition we propose a foot design for prosthetic or humanoid feet which preserves key features of adaptive feet but does not require actuation, and show that it reduces the energetic cost by 15{\%} or more independent of the walking speed. We conclude that human evolution may have traded the advantages of adaptive feet for energy efficiency, and that robotic systems could gain the former without compromising on the latter.},

abstract = {Nematic liquid crystal elastomers are thermally actuated to produce macroscopic, anisotropic shape changes. Uniaxial contraction and extension of liquid crystal elastomers can be achieved by cycling the temperature of the material through the nematic to isotropic phase transition. In this report, a new approach is introduced by layering liquid crystal elastomer films to create thermally actuated stacks. A heating element and thermally conductive grease embedded between elastomer films provide a means for rapid internal heat application and distribution when a current is passed through the heating element, thus providing contractile force production in a minimal amount of time. Upon voltage application, stacks composed of two 100 ??m-thick films and a single heating element produce 18{\%} strain between contracted and relaxed states. In addition, the stacked elastomer films are capable of producing 10{\%} contraction within 1 s and the blocked stress of the thermally actuated stacked films is calculated to be 130 kPa. The stacking approach provides new opportunities to use liquid crystal elastomers in applications requiring forces greater than those capable of being produced by single elastomer films. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

abstract = {People with unilateral, transtibial amputation (TTA) have an increased prevalence of chronic low back pain (LBP) relative to able-bodied people. However, a definitive cause of increased LBP susceptibility has not been determined. The purpose of this work was to compare dynamic trunk–pelvis biomechanics between people with (n=6) and without (n=6) unilateral TTA during walking using a computational modeling approach. A generic, muscle-actuated whole body model was scaled to each participant, and experimental walking data were used in a static optimization framework to calculate trunk–pelvis motion, L4L5 joint contact forces, and muscle forces within the trunk–pelvis region. Results included several significant between-group differences in trunk–pelvis biomechanics during different phases of the gait cycle. Most significant was greater lateral bending toward the residual side during residual single-limb stance (p{\textless}0.01), concurrent with an elevated L4L5 joint contact force (p=0.02) and greater muscle force from the intact-side obliques (p{\textless}0.01) in people with TTA relative to able-bodied people. During both double-limb support phases, people with TTA also had a greater range of axial trunk rotation away from the leading limb, concurrent with greater ranges of muscle forces in the erector spinae and obliques. In addition, a greater range of force (p=0.03) in residual-side psoas was found during early residual limb swing in people with TTA. Repeated exposure to atypical motion and joint/muscle loading in people with TTA may contribute to the development of secondary musculoskeletal disorders, including chronic, mechanical LBP.},

abstract = {Dynamic joint stiffness is a dynamic, nonlinear relationship between the position of a joint and the torque acting about it, which can be used to describe the biomechanics of the joint and associated limb(s). This paper models and quantifies changes in ankle dynamic stiffness and its individual elements, intrinsic and reflex stiffness, in healthy human subjects during isometric, time-varying (TV) contractions of the ankle plantarflexor muscles. A subspace, linear parameter varying, parallel-cascade (LPV-PC) algorithm was used to identify the model from measured input position perturbations and output torque data using voluntary torque as the LPV scheduling variable (SV). Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrated that the algorithm is accurate, precise and robust to colored measurement noise. The algorithm was then used to examine stiffness changes associated with TV isometric contractions. The SV was estimated from the Soleus EMG using a Hammerstein model of EMG-torque dynamics identified from unperturbed trials. The LPV-PC algorithm identified (i) a non-parametric LPV impulse response function (LPV IRF) for intrinsic stiffness and (ii) a LPV-Hammerstein model for reflex stiffness consisting of a LPV static nonlinearity followed by a time-invariant state-space model of reflex dynamics. The results demonstrated that: (a) intrinsic stiffness, in particular ankle elasticity, increased significantly and monotonically with activation level; (b) the gain of the reflex pathway increased from rest to around 10{\%}-20{\%} of subject's MVC and then declined; and (c) the reflex dynamics were second order. These findings suggest that in healthy human ankle, reflex stiffness contributes most at low muscle contraction levels, whereas, intrinsic contributions monotonically increase with activation level.},

A magnetorheological (MR) actuator is developed to be used in assistive knee braces to provide controllable torque. TheMR actuator can work as a brake or a clutch. When active torque is needed, the DC motor works and the MR actuator functions as a clutch to transfer the torque generated by the motor to the leg; when passive torque is desired, the DC motor is turned off and theMR actuator functions as a brake to provide controllable passive torque. The prototype of the developedMR actuator is fabricated and experiments are carried out to investigate the characteristics of theMR actuator. The results show that theMR actuator is able to provide sufficient torque needed for normal human activities. Adaptive control is proposed for controlling the MR actuator. Anti-windup strategy is used to achieve better control performance. Experiments on the MR actuator under control are also performed to study the torque tracking ability of the system.},

@article{Eslamy2013,
abstract = {In this paper we investigated on peak power (PP) and energy (ER) requirements for different active ankle actuation concepts that can have both elasticity and damping characteristics. A lower PP or ER requirement is an important issue because it will lead to a smaller motor or battery. In addition to spring, these actuation concepts are assumed to have (passive) damper in series (series elastic-damper actuator SEDA) or parallel (parallel elastic-damper actuator PEDA) to the motor. For SEA (series elastic actuator), SEDA and PEDA, we calculated the required minimum motor PP and ER in different human gaits: normal level walking, ascending and descending the stairs. We found that for level walking and ascending the stairs, the SEA concept, and for descending, the SEDA, were the favorable concepts to reduce required minimum PP and ER in comparison to a DD (direct drive) concept. In SEDA concept, the minimum PP could be reduced to half of what SEA would require. Nevertheless, it was found that spring was always required, however damper showed 'task specific' advantages. As a result, if a simple design perspective is in mind, from PP-ER viewpoint, SEA could be the best compromise to be used for different above-mentioned gaits. For SEDA or PEDA concepts, a controllable damper should be used. In addition, our results show that it is beneficial to select spring stiffness in SEA, based on level walking gait. The PP and ER requirements would increase very slightly for stairs ascending, and to some extent (10.5{\%}) for descending as a consequence of this selection. In contrast, stiffness selection based on stair ascending or descending, increases the PP requirements of level walking more noticeably (17-24{\%}).},

@article{Silverman2012,
abstract = {Unilateral, below-knee amputees have altered gait mechanics, which can significantly affect their mobility. Below-knee amputees lose the functional use of the ankle muscles, which are critical during walking to provide body support, forward propulsion, leg-swing initiation and mediolateral balance. Thus, either muscles must compensate or the prosthesis must provide the functional tasks normally provided by the ankle muscles. Three-dimensional (3D) forward dynamics simulations of amputee and non-amputee walking were generated to identify muscle and prosthesis contributions to amputee walking mechanics, including the subtasks of body support, forward propulsion, leg-swing initiation and mediolateral balance. Results showed that the prosthesis provided body support in the absence of the ankle muscles. The prosthesis contributed to braking from early to mid-stance and propulsion in late stance. The prosthesis also functioned like the uniarticular soleus muscle by transferring energy from the residual leg to the trunk to provide trunk propulsion. The residual-leg vasti and rectus femoris reduced their contributions to braking in early stance, which mitigated braking from the prosthesis during this period. The prosthesis did not replace the function of the gastrocnemius, which normally generates energy to the leg to initiate swing. As a result, lower overall energy was delivered to the residual leg. The prosthesis also acted to accelerate the body laterally in the absence of the ankle muscles. These results provide further insight into muscle and prosthesis function in below-knee amputee walking and can help guide rehabilitation methods and device designs to improve amputee mobility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dynamic stiffness can be used for studying foot pathologic abnormalities and for developing prostheses and orthoses. Although previous works have studied the role of ankle joint stiffness during gait, other foot joints have not yet been analyzed. We sought to characterize the dynamic stiffness of the ankle, midtarsal, and metatarsophalangeal joints during normal walking. METHODS Kinematics and contact data from four healthy individuals during walking were registered with a three-dimensional motion analysis system and a pressure platform. Stance phases with flexion moment-angle linear relationships were identified, and dynamic stiffnesses were calculated from the slope of their linear regressions. Intraparticipant repeatability was analyzed using analyses of variance, and interparticipant variability was checked through the SD of averaged participant stiffnesses. RESULTS Flexion moment-angle linear relationships were identified (R(2) {\textgreater}0.98) during the early and late midstance phases and the propulsion phase at the ankle (2.76, 5.23, and 3.42 N{\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad, respectively) and midtarsal (15.88, 3.90, and 4.64 N{\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad, respectively) joints. At the metatarsophalangeal joint, a linear relationship (R(2) {\textgreater}0.96) occurred only during the propulsion phase (0.11 N{\textperiodcentered}m/kg/rad). High dynamic stiffness variability was observed during the late and early midstance phases at the ankle and midtarsal joints, respectively. CONCLUSIONS These results may serve as a basis for future studies aimed at investigating the role of dynamic stiffness identified herein in different foot disorders. The importance of properly controlling the samples in such studies is highlighted. Study of the dynamic stiffnesses identified might be used in the design of prostheses, orthoses, and other assistive devices.},

In our previous studies of the porous SBIP-1 and SBIP-2 prototypes, the bond site between the porous pylons and residuum bone and skin did not show the inflammation characteristically observed when solid pylons are used. At the same time, porosity diminished the strength of the pylon. To find a reasonable balance between the biological conductivity and the strength of the porous pylon, we developed a mathematical model of the composite permeable structure. A novel manufacturing process was implemented, and the new SBIP-3 prototype was tested mechanically. The minimal strength requirements established earlier for the SBIP were exceeded threefold. The first histopathological analysis of skin, bone, and the implanted SBIP-2 pylons was conducted on two rats and one cat. The histopathological analysis provided new evidence of inflammation-free, deep ingrowth of skin and bone cells throughout the SBIP structure.},

abstract = {In some embodiments of a prosthetic or orthotic ankle/foot, a prediction is made of what the walking speed will be during an upcoming step. When the predicted walking speed is slow, the characteristics of the apparatus are then modified so that less net-work that is performed during that step (as compared to when the predicted walking speed is fast). This may be implemented using one sensor from which the walking speed can be predicted, and a second sensor from which ankle torque can be determined. A controller receives inputs from those sensors, and controls a motor's torque so that the torque for slow walking speeds is lower than the torque for fast walking speeds. This reduces the work performed by the actuator over a gait cycle and the peak actuator power delivered during the gait cycle. In some embodiments, a series elastic element is connected in series with a motor that can drive the ankle, and at least one sensor is provided with an output from which a deflection of the series elastic element can be determined. A controller determines a desired torque based on the output, and controls the motor's torque based on the determined desired torque.},

abstract = {Actuator efficiency is an important factor in the design of powered leg prostheses, orthoses, exoskeletons, and legged robots. A continuously-variable series-elastic actuator (CV-SEA) is presented as an efficient actuator for legged locomotion. The CV-SEA implements a continuously-variable transmission (CVT) between a motor and series elastic element. The CVT reduces the torque seen at the motor and allows the motor to operate in speed regimes of higher efficiency, while the series-elastic element efficiently stores and releases mechanical energy, reducing motor work requirements for actuator applications where an elastic response is sought. An energy efficient control strategy for the CV-SEA was developed using a Monte-Carlo minimization method that randomly generates transmission profiles and converges on those that minimize the electrical energy consumption of the motor. The CV-SEA is compared to a standard SEA and an infinitely variable series elastic actuator (IV-SEA). Simulations suggest that a CV-SEA will require less energy that an SEA or IV-SEA when used in a knee prosthesis during level-ground walking.},

This paper explores the potential that this technology has on the manufacture of prosthetic feet for children from developing countries – specifically referring to the variance in sizes as the child grows. An exploration of the design process undertaken in an industrial design honours year demonstrates how a low-cost (approx. AUD{\$}15.00 at wholesale material prices), 3D-printed prosthetic foot has a comparable, if not better, performance level than a SACH foot – the type of foot typically donated to provide aid to those from developing countries who would otherwise be unserved. Prototyping was undertaken using a hobby-level printer (the Makerbot Replicator 2) and Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament. This method of prototyping allowed the designer to undertake rapid iterations of the prototype to undergo basic testing using autoethnographic methods. The prosthesis' ability to be modified and produced on-site, on- demand could potentially redefine the opportunities available to prosthetists for accommodating varying gait patterns when providing low-cost aid to developing countries.},

@article{Teixeira-Salmela2008,
abstract = {Background: Information regarding kinetic changes associated with walking speed is important for identifying alterations in locomotor disorders caused by pathological processes, as opposed to those arising solely from altered speeds. Methods: Fourteen healthy subjects were assessed walking at both natural and imposed cadences of 60, 80, and 120 steps/min. A 3D motion analysis system, force platforms, and related software were used to obtain kinematic and kinetic data. Net joint powers were calculated across cycles and the area under the positive and negative phases of the power curves provided the mechanical work generated and absorbed at the hip, knee, and ankle. The relative contributions to the total positive and negative work across the four cadences were calculated for each joint. ANOVAs followed by planned contrasts were used to assess the effects of laterality, joint, and cadence. Findings: Power and mechanical work, as well as the contributions of individual joints to the total energy generated and absorbed, were shown to be influenced by walking cadence, independent of laterality. The ankle, knee, and hip contributions to the total limb generation and absorption at the lowest cadence were 53{\%}, 21{\%}, and 26{\%}, and at the highest cadence, the corresponding values were 34{\%}, 33{\%}, and 33{\%}, respectively. Interpretation: Power and mechanical work, as well as the contributions of individual joints to the total energy generated and absorbed, were shown to be influenced by the walking cadence, independent of laterality. These findings will be helpful for identifying walking strategies and adaptations in populations with gait disorders. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Esteban P{\'{e}}rez-Pevida et al.The objective of the present study is to evaluate how the elastic properties of the fabrication material of dental implants influence peri-implant bone load transfer in terms of the magnitude and distribution of stress and deformation. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis was performed; the model used was a section of mandibular bone with a single implant containing a cemented ceramic-metal crown on a titanium abutment. The following three alloys were compared: rigid (Y-TZP), conventional (Ti-6Al-4V), and hyperelastic (Ti-Nb-Zr). A 150-N static load was tested on the central fossa at 6° relative to the axial axis of the implant. The results showed no differences in the distribution of stress and deformation of the bone for any of the three types of alloys studied, mainly being concentrated at the peri-implant cortical layer. However, there were differences found in the magnitude of the stress transferred to the supporting bone, with the most rigid alloy (Y-TZP) transferring the least stress and deformation to cortical bone. We conclude that there is an effect of the fabrication material of dental implants on the magnitude of the stress and deformation transferred to peri-implant bone.},

abstract = {This brief presents a novel application of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) for optimal adaptive control of powered lower limb prostheses, a type of wearable robots to assist the motor function of the limb amputees. Current control of these robotic devices typically relies on finite state impedance control (FS-IC), which lacks adaptability to the user's physical condition. As a result, joint impedance settings are often customized manually and heuristically in clinics, which greatly hinder the wide use of these advanced medical devices. This simulation study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of ADP for automatic tuning of the twelve knee joint impedance parameters during a complete gait cycle to achieve balanced walking. Given that the accurate models of human walking dynamics are difficult to obtain, the model-free ADP control algorithms were considered. First, direct heuristic dynamic programming (dHDP) was applied to the control problem, and its performance was evaluated on OpenSim, an often-used dynamic walking simulator. For the comparison purposes, we selected another established ADP algorithm, the neural fitted Q with continuous action (NFQCA). In both cases, the ADP controllers learned to control the right knee joint and achieved balanced walking, but dHDP outperformed NFQCA in this application during a 200 gait cycle-based testing.},

It is critical to characterize ankle impedance during the stance phase of walking to elucidate how ankle impedance is regulated during locomotion, as well as provide the foundation for future development of natural, biomimetic powered prostheses and their control systems. In this study, ankle impedance was estimated using a model consisting of stiffness, damping and inertia. Ankle torque was well described by the model, accounting for 98 ±1.2{\%} of the variance. When averaged across subjects, the stiffness component of impedance was found to increase linearly from 1.5 to 6.5 Nm/rad/kg between 20{\%} and 70{\%} of stance phase. The damping component was found to be statistically greater than zero only for the estimate at 70{\%} of stance phase, with a value of 0.03 Nms/rad/kg. The slope of the ankle's torque-angle curve-known as the quasi-stiffness-was not statistically different from the ankle stiffness values, and showed remarkable similarity. Finally, using the estimated impedance, the specifications for a biomimetic powered ankle prosthesis were introduced that would accurately emulate human ankle impedance during locomotion.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: People with a lower-extremity amputation that use conventional passive-elastic ankle-foot prostheses encounter a series of stress-related challenges during walking such as greater forces on their unaffected leg, and may thus be predisposed to secondary musculoskeletal injuries such as chronic joint disorders. Specifically, people with a unilateral transtibial amputation have an increased susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis, especially in their unaffected leg. Previous studies have hypothesized that the development of this disorder is linked to the abnormally high peak knee external adduction moments encountered during walking. An ankle-foot prosthesis that supplies biomimetic power could potentially mitigate the forces and knee adduction moments applied to the unaffected leg of a person with a transtibial amputation, which could, in turn, reduce the risk of knee osteoarthritis. We hypothesized that compared to using a passive-elastic prosthesis, people with a transtibial amputation using a powered ankle-foot prosthesis would have lower peak resultant ground reaction forces, peak external knee adduction moments, and corresponding loading rates applied to their unaffected leg during walking over a wide range of speeds. Methods: We analyzed ground reaction forces and knee joint kinetics of the unaffected leg of seven participants with a unilateral transtibial amputation and seven age-, height- and weight-matched non-amputees during level-ground walking at 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, and 1.75 m/s. Subjects with an amputation walked while using their own passive-elastic prosthesis and a powered ankle-foot prosthesis capable of providing net positive mechanical work and powered ankle plantar flexion during late stance. Results: Use of the powered prosthesis significantly decreased unaffected leg peak resultant forces by 2-11{\%} at 0.75-1.50 m/s, and first peak knee external adduction moments by 21 and 12{\%} at 1.50 and 1.75 m/s, respectively. Loading rates were not significantly different between prosthetic feet. Conclusions: Use of a biomimetic powered ankle-foot prosthesis decreased peak resultant force at slow and moderate speeds and knee external adduction moment at moderate and fast speeds on the unaffected leg of people with a transtibial amputation during level-ground walking. Thus, use of an ankle-foot prosthesis that provides net positive mechanical work could reduce the risk of comorbidities such as knee osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {The ankle contributes the majority of mechanical power during walking and is a frequently studied joint in biomechanics. Specifically, researchers have extensively investigated the torque-angle relationship for the ankle during dynamic tasks, such as walking and running. The slope of this relationship has been termed the "quasi-stiffness." However, over time, researchers have begun to interchange the concepts of quasi-stiffness and stiffness. This is an especially important distinction as researchers currently begin to investigate the appropriate control systems for recently developed powered prosthetic legs. The quasi-stiffness and stiffness are distinct concepts in the context of powered joints, and are equivalent in the context of passive joints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the difference between the stiffness and quasi-stiffness using a simple impedance-controlled inverted pendulum model and a more sophisticated biped walking model, each with the ability to modify the trajectory of an impedance controller's equilibrium angle position. In both cases, stiffness values are specified by the controller and the quasi-stiffness are shown during a single step. Both models have widely varying quasi-stiffness but each have a single stiffness value. Therefore, from this simple modeling approach, the differences and similarities between these two concepts are elucidated.},

The intent of this article is to provide information regarding the current advancements in the adaptive sports technology and biomechanics in the field of prosthetics, and to assist clinicians and their patients in facilitating participation in sporting activities.},

abstract = { Smooth trajectories are essential for safe interaction in between human and a haptic interface. Different methods and strategies have been introduced to create such smooth trajectories. This paper studies the creation of human-like movements in haptic interfaces, based on the study of human arm motion. These motions are intended to retrain the upper limb movements of patients that lose manipulation functions following stroke. We present a model that uses higher degree polynomials to define a trajectory and control the robot arm to achieve minimum jerk movements. It also studies different methods that can be driven from polynomials to create more realistic human-like movements for therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {The use of multi-axis waterjet machines as a manufacturing tool is rapidly increasing. A wide range of materials can be machined ranging from carbon fibre composites on the latest aircraft fuselages to difficult to machine exotic alloys and state of the art metal matrix composite materials. This work presents an overview of the range of materials and gives examples of geometries that can now be formed using this technique. The surface finish and processing interaction during machining is also outlined. Cutting, drilling and to a limited extent, milling will be considered. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
